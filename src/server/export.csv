17/05/2018,17/05/18,1,"Mawda Shawri (2, girl)",Iraq,"Kurd, killed by runaway police bullet near Mons (B) in wild pursuit of migrant vehicle headed for UK","In the night to May 17, 2018, around 3am near Namur, the Belgian police was alerted to a vehicle with a number plate not conform to regulations and started to follow it along the E42 highway. The vehicle was driven by a smuggler and carried Kurdish refugees (26 adults and 4 children) aiming to reach Great-Britain. As it did not stop, the pursuit lasted for about an hour and involved many police vehicles. The driver kept escaping, threw objects onto the highway, attempted to induce accidents and to hit police vehicles. People in the vehicle held children out the window to ward off the police. Near the highway parking of Maisieres, near Mons, the vehicle finally halted after police had shot a bullet. A 2-year-old girl, Mawda Shawri, was heavily bleeding and died on the way to hospital. Initially it was reported that the cause of her death could not be a police bullet and might be due to an accident between vehicles. However it turned out that a police bullet had hit her cheek. Mawda’s family are Kurds from Iraq who attempted to come back to Great-Britain via Belgium after they had been relocated to Germany. Her parents also have a son aged 3.The police and Mawda’s family tell different versions of the story, and the family’s lawyer has therefore asked for an independent investigation. He affirms that the policeman responsible has been identified but not arrested. The incident was widely reported and caused intense and differing reactions from civil organizations, politicians and the public. There have been migrant protests as well as peaceful support vigils.",50.481514,3.951917,Maisieres,Belgium,AD/RTBF/RTLbe/DH,https://www.rtl.be/info/regions/hainaut/la-police-intercepte-une-camionnette-avec-26-migrants-a-bord-et-decouvre-le-corps-d-une-fillette-de-deux-ans-1022681.aspx,1,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,4279,Klara,06/06/2018,New Entry,06/06/2018,Klara

REUTERS/Kepa FuentesHuge numbers of migrants have converged on Libya in recent years in the hope of crossing the Mediterranean to Europe, and many of those who avoid drowning are arriving in Italy in terrible physical shape.On Monday, a ship run by Proactiva Open Arms, a Spanish charity, brought 93 people including the Eritrean to Italy after rescuing them on Sunday from an overcrowded rubber boat off Libya. The man, Segen, whose full name was not given, disembarked in Pozzallo, a port on the southern coast of Sicily.Weighing only 35 kg (77 pounds), the 1.70 m (5 ft 7 inch) tall Segen needed help to walk and was immediately taken to hospital, where he died less than 12 hours later, according to Roberto Ammatuna, the mayor of Pozzallo and head of the local hospital’s emergency room.A 22-year-old Eritrean man is seen on Proactiva Open Arms rescue ship after being rescued in the Mediterranean sea off Libya coast March 11, 2018. Picture taken March 11, 2018. REUTERS/Kepa Fuentes“He looked like he had been in a concentration camp,” Ammatuna told Reuters. “All the migrants who arrived on Monday were skin and bones, and their muscles were atrophied. Obviously the conditions in Libya are inhuman.”Three other men were taken to hospital because of weakness and malnutrition. In January, a three-month-old baby rescued by Proactiva died partly because of severe malnutrition, the group’s medical coordinator, Guillermo Canardo, said.People traffickers in Libya have sent hundreds of thousands of migrants to sea over the past four years, but departures have fallen dramatically since July as some local armed groups stopped smuggling and Italy and the European Union helped bolster the Tripoli-based coast guard.TRAPPEDArrivals in Italy from Libya have dropped more than 72 percent this year from last, official data show. That means many may have been trapped in widely lawless Libya for longer periods than before.“Migrants tell me they have been in Libya longer than I was hearing a year ago,” Marco Rotunno of the United Nations refugee agency said.Slideshow (2 Images)Segen told the doctor on board the Proactiva ship that he had been in Libya for about 18 months.Migrants who travelled with Segen said they had been held by smugglers in a large warehouse for months, where they were tortured and beaten, according to Medu, a charity providing psychological support to those who arrive in Pozzallo. They told Medu they paid about $1,500 to make the sea crossing.The United Nations estimates that hundreds of thousands of migrants remain in Libya. Those who make it to Italy tell of being extorted, beaten, tortured, raped, starved and forced to work for no pay.Even those in officially sanctioned detention centres or living openly in Libya have next to no access to healthcare and depend on international agencies that have a limited presence on the ground, said Christophe Biteau, Libya head of mission for MSF France.“You have people who are on the road for months. You have people who are malnourished, and mainly illnesses linked to lack of hygiene - scabies, diarrhoea, skin infections. After that there’s what you don’t see, the psychological aspect, which I think is very significant.”Segen’s death confirms data collected by Medu over the past four years, Alberto Barbieri, director of Medu, told Reuters.About 70 percent of migrants interviewed by Medu said they were deprived of food and water while in Libya. “Many others die in Libya and we know nothing about it,” Barbieri said.Additional reporting by Aidan Lewis in Tunis; Editing by David Stamp/Mark HeinrichOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",36.83992253,14.76583753,"Modica, Sicily",Italy,Proactiva/IOM/ANSA/Reuters/LocalIT/HRW,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-italy/migrant-death-in-italy-points-to-dire-conditions-in-libya-aid-workers-idUSKCN1GQ2K7,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,4048,Klara,08/05/2018,New Entry,19/04/2018,Dorien

(4 chn; 1 woman; 14 man),Somalia/Eritrea,"died in vehicle accident 60 km south east of Bani Waleed (Libya), 159 survivors/Iretri","http://bit.ly/2HdQAvEPressure is mounting on the international community to do more to tackle the migration crisis in Libya following a truck crash on Wednesday, which left 19 people dead.A truck carrying an estimated 300 refugees and migrants tipped over in the northwest of the North African country.Smugglers had been attempting to transport the group of migrants to Tarhuna, a town 40 miles southeast of the Libyan capital Tripoli, the UN migration agency (IOM) said.Overloaded with passengers, survivors said the truck crashed when it drove into a hole in the road. Many of those on board had been crammed into cargo containers.""Our priority needs to be protecting these migrants and others throughout the country, while making migration through Libya safe and regular,"" said Othman Belbesi, IOM Libya Chief of Mission.""One death whether in the desert or at sea is one too many.”Libya is a major staging post for migrants hoping to reach Europe from the rest of Africa. Of the migrants involved in the truck crash, 138 were Eritrean while the rest were from Somalia and Ethiopia.The UN evacuated over 1,000 refugees from Libya since November, the organisation’s refugee agency the UNHCR announced on Thursday.The UNHCR said two flights only this week had taken 278 vulnerable refugees from Tripoli to Rome, Italy and Niamey, Niger.“These evacuations have provided a new chance at life for more than 1,000 refugees who were detained in Libya and suffered tremendously,” said Vincent Cochetel, UNHCR’s special Envoy for the Central Mediterranean. “By the end of 2018, we hope to evacuate thousands more.”The agency said it was looking for “durable solutions” in third countries for the 1,084 refugees that have been evacuated. However, Mr Cochetel called on other countries to provide additional places to help with the resettlement process.“These evacuations are the best example of the impact that international solidarity can have on refugees themselves; however, much more needs to be done. Only 16,940 resettlement places have been received so far for the 15 priority countries of asylum along the Central Mediterranean route, including Libya and Niger.“We call on all countries to come forth with additional places that will provide a tangible solution for many more refugees who are still in Libya,” said Mr Cochetel._______________Read more:Scores of Pakistanis feared drowned after migrant boat capsizes off Libya19 migrants killed in Libya truck crash_______________Last year 171,635 migrants and refugees entered Europe by sea during 2017, many of which came from Libya, according to statistics by the IOM.The North African country’s coastline is an attractive prospect for people smugglers because it is largely unpoliced.A study published last year by the UNHCR found that around half of those travelling to Libya intend to stay there because the country once offered the best employment opportunities in the region.However, the difficult economic situation since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi has led to many fleeing to Europe instead, risking life and death on the treacherous journey across the Mediterranean.Migrant arrivals in Europe were far lower in 2017 than in 2016, partly thanks to an agreement made in August between the EU and Italy in which they trained the Libyan coastguard to intercept boats and return the people on board to Libya. The number of arrivals across the region more than halved from 363,504 the year before.But aid agencies criticised the deal, which has led to a huge increase in the number of migrants being detained, over concerns about conditions in detention centres.Amnesty International said detainees were at almost certain risk of “torture, rape and even of being killed”.",31.61415428,14.67440354,As Saddadah (60 km SE of Bani Waleed) and Tarhuna,Libya,DTM/NationalAE/Reuters/MENAFN/IOMLibya,http://bit.ly/2BXCvmR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,19,,,,,,19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4072,Anouska,15/05/2018,New entry,24/04/2018,Dorien

Some wore life jackets. But there were a lot of life jackets without any bodies inside. At first I saw just one body, then another and another and another. It was terrible. It’s a moment I’ll never forget.”Mamadou Laly ""Le Grand"" Barry, 30.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThis is the memory of the crew member who first alerted Spanish Maritime Rescue to a capsized boat on Feb. 4. He was working on a ferry en route to Melilla, one of two Spanish enclaves still remaining in northern Africa. The ferry is part of Trasmediterránea’s large fleet and makes a daily trip between Melilla and Almería, on the Spanish mainland, carrying up to 1,250 passengers on each crossing.Some 4,000 miles away, my cell phone started ringing. I spent most of the following week on the phone with families across West Africa who were desperately searching for any information about their loved ones.Tidiane Jalloh ""TJ""  Bah, 17.Credit: Courtesy of the familyMy son, is he alive? My wife, have they found her body yet? When will we know? How will we know? Is anyone looking for them?For tourists seeking a day-trip to Morocco, there are a host of ferry options from Spain — most take 30 minutes and cost 25 euros per passenger. For African migrants, refugees and asylum seekers seeking the chance at a better life in Europe, there are a host of smuggling options running the same routes in reverse. Most take a full day’s journey at sea and cost an average of 2,000 euros per passenger.Tahirou Barry, 22.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBoarding one of Trasmediterránea’s new ferries, you might notice a small sign warning you of seasickness. Boarding one of the small wooden fishing boats that smugglers captain from Morocco’s coast, migrants don’t need a sign warning them that, as one 15-year-old boy tells me, “You’ll make it to Europe or you’ll die trying.”A difficult processAfter being alerted to bodies floating in the open sea, Maritime Rescue sent a ship from Melilla to begin searching for survivors, and the Guardia Civil launched two smaller rescue missions as well. In the hours that followed, the Royal Navy of Morocco ended up recovering the majority of the bodies, which had drifted to their coastline by the time they responded.Mohammed Diallo, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThe officers placed 20 bodies in one massive, blue plastic bag made for tragedies like this and took them to El Hassani Hospital in Nador. The one body recovered by Spanish police was taken to Melilla. At the morgue, I was told recently, 16 of the 20 bodies remain unidentified.“We have a poster hanging in the police station in Nador with pictures of each face, so the families can identify them,"" an official said.But their families aren’t in Morocco, and the friends of these victims live hidden in forest camps that are routinely under attack by Moroccan police, who threaten to beat, imprison or deport anyone found. The lack of official reporting by Spain and Morocco means family members are left with more questions than answers, often learning about the passing of loved ones from Facebook posts months after an incident has occurred.Abdul Karim Barry, 17.Credit: Courtesy of the familyA short, dangerous crossingMorocco offers the shortest passage to Europe of any African country — less than eight miles across the Mediterranean Sea — and the Spanish enclaves of Melilla and Ceuta make it the only country on the African continent to share a land border with the internally borderless EU.It is one of the most trafficked border regions in the world right now, with the number of people attempting to escape violence and poverty across West and Central Africa growing daily. The closing of other primary routes to Europe in Libya, where migrants are now being bought and sold in an emergent slave trade, is pushing more people to Morocco’s borders.Houseine Traoré, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBut the steady reinforcement of the Spain-Morocco land border, which is now secured by three rings of 20-foot high razor-wire fences and under constant surveillance by the Guardia Civil, means even more are attempting treacherous sea crossings.According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the number of migrants reaching Spain by way of the Mediterranean tripled to nearly 22,000 last year, and the number of reported drownings off the Spanish coast doubled. However, the 223 drownings reported in 2017 only account for bodies that were recovered and identified.Hassane Traoré, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyLess than two months into 2018, there have already been 75 victims recovered, including the 21 found floating off the coast of Melilla last month. How many others remain in the water?No namesThe week of the incident, major news organizations from The New York Times to El Mundo covered the latest Mediterranean tragedy, but regardless of which source you follow, you read the same facts.Alpha Moron Diallo, 23.Credit: Courtesy of the familyTwenty-one bodies. All African migrants. All packed into a small wooden fishing boat that capsized off the coast of Morocco’s Spanish enclave.There was no follow-up as the victim count edged upward, ultimately winding up more than double what was originally reported.As I followed the coverage by various sources, I noticed there was never a single name released.Who are all of these people, assigned numbers, not names, in the morgue? Where were they coming from, what had driven them to their final crossing, and what had they expected to find on the other side?Alhassane Barry, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyI needed more than a number. I didn’t want to simply break the news that it was 47 migrants and two smugglers, not 21 people, who were lost at sea. I wanted to report who had been lost. I enlisted the migrants still living in Morocco’s hidden camps to help me collect names, faces and stories. They knew better than anyone the group who left just after nightfall on Feb. 3 to walk 16 miles to the meeting point their smugglers had given them.An anthropologist by training, I started working on issues of migration and international human rights a decade ago and have spent many years living in the hundreds of makeshift camps around primary departure points in Morocco, Algeria and Libya. The first time I gained access to Carrière — one of Morocco’s largest and most tightly controlled camps — was when I was working on another story for PRI in the summer of 2016.Amoudoubailo Diallo, 20.Credit: Courtesy of the familyIt was a complicated process requiring permitting at the governmental level and clearance at the local level — from the smuggling rings that control the space and the brotherhoods of migrants themselves.I spent the following year in the region finishing a documentary film that captures the journeys of three migrants from Guinea, Mali and the DRC to their final attempted crossings. I was back in Carrière as recently as last month. In fact, I had only been back in the US for a week when I received my first phone call alerting me to the capsized boat carrying people I knew well.Bouboucar Bah, 32.Credit: Courtesy of the family'Smart, brave, generous'The photograph of Abdul Karim Barry — a 17-year-old boy from Guinea — was one of the first I saw.Karim had been in Carrière awaiting his chance at crossing for over two years. He left his home at the age of 15 and traveled more than 3,000 miles alone — from Guinea to Morocco. After his father died, he felt responsible for taking care of his younger brothers and sisters when his mother couldn’t find any way to support the family in their rural community. He wanted to give his siblings the chance to go to school like his father had given him.Ben Ali Bah, 24.Credit: Courtesy of the family“Karim was smart and brave and above all, he was generous,” one of his closest friends, Mamadou Bah, tells me over a crackling phone line. “He always struggled for the well-being of the group, even risking the dangers of going into the street to beg for us when we couldn't find enough food to eat. It was Karim who prepared the one daily meal for our brotherhood every night.”I posted a photograph of him and asked his friends in Morocco and Guinea to help me make him more than a number.“Karim studied hard before leaving home,” Thierno Jalloh wrote, “and he used his education to speak up for the other boys who didn't have any. He was young, but he was a natural leader with a big heart. He couldn’t stand for anyone to be treated as less than human because of the color of their skin.”Alpha ""Bambino"" Bah, 14.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAbdoulaye Barry wrote, “He told me he dreamed of becoming a soccer player when he was little. He played on a team in Guinea, and he was really good. But as you grow older, you realize some of your dreams won’t ever be realized. Still, Karim played with me in the forest sometimes. We had a ball we made out of plastic and tape.”Rough conditionsIn the hours before the first bodies were spotted, Karim, along with 46 men, women, and children coming from Guinea, Cote D’Ivoire, Cameroon, Senegal and Mali left their camp in Carrière. Their smugglers, two Moroccan men, were waiting for them on a rocky beach in Arekmane.Mamadou Billo Diallo, 25.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThey carried a small wooden fishing boat that had been rigged with an outboard motor down to the water. A witness who traveled with the migrants but didn’t board the boat that night said the winds were too strong for a safe crossing — 50 mph, according to official reports.So why would smugglers choose to travel, risking their own lives, under such rough conditions?In previous years, they wouldn’t have. But new systems created to protect migrants’ financial investments have made tragedies like this one significantly more likely. In 2016, I knew dozens of migrants who were devastated when they paid 1,500 to 2,500 euros and failed to reach the other side. This left them trapped in Morocco for many more years, struggling to save up enough money to try again.Amoudou Taibou Diallo, 16.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThis past summer, I noticed a niche market had emerged with some smugglers stepping into the business of transferring money from migrant to smuggler — only after they had safely reached Spanish soil. For a 10 percent increase in fee, migrants can now pay these third parties and secure their investments.Those who find themselves back in Morocco after a boat has capsized or a police vessel has re-routed them, as happens more often than not, have the money to try again.For the smugglers who captained the boat on Feb. 4, a postponed departure would have meant approximately 96,000 euros returned. Another factor: The witness explained how smugglers often call for last-minute departures when bad weather is on the horizon, knowing storms make it easier to evade surveillance efforts by the Guardia Civil.Mamadou Aliou ""Barkley"" Diallo, 34.Credit: Courtesy of the familyWith an overcrowded boat and waves reaching three meters high, they capsized less than an hour into their journey. The passengers were thrown into freezing water without enough life jackets — many of them not knowing how to swim. The oldest reported passenger on board was 34, the youngest had just turned 14. There were at least eight women, one of them pregnant.Lone survivorTwo days after the tragedy, the Royal Navy of Morocco reported that, miraculously, one young man from Mali had been found alive. After a series of interrogations, he was accused of taking part in an illegal operation and is currently being held in police custody.The Nadori police told me they are continuing to search for the top-level smugglers thought to have masterminded this operation and many others like it.Oury Diallo, 18.Credit: Courtesy of the familyPhotographs, names and questions have poured in ever since. Along with them, I received final videos that were recorded by young men like Mamadou Diallo, 21, who tells his mother, “I’ve suffered greatly in my journey to Morocco, but it’s all been worthwhile because, soon, I’ll be calling you from Spain.”And Safourata Sow, 28, who tells her three daughters how much she loves them and misses them.Again and again, I listened to the words of Karim, who was one of the last boys I interviewed in person. Sitting by his makeshift tent he tells me, “We've traveled so far, we've been through so much, I finally understand what my brothers meant when they told me, 'I'll make it to Europe or I'll die trying.' After you've endured the horrors of this journey to Morocco, there's only one way home.”Mamadou Saliou Bah, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the familyGiven the lack of access to basic social services and the active fighting in some communities in West Africa, it is not uncommon to hear of boys like Karim traveling thousands of miles north in search of a way to support their families. Hassane and Houseine Traoré — 28-year-old twin brothers from Cote D’Ivoire — had a similar story to tell.“They were the coolest guys,” says an old friend, Stephanie Dokou, who grew up with them in Cote D’Ivoire. “They were the best athletes our village had ever seen, they played music and sang, they did well in school. All the girls loved them. We knew they would go on to do great things.”Jalloh ""JJ"" Thierno Bah, 26.Credit: Courtesy of the family“They were always together,” explains another old friend, Y’souf Bella. ""One never did anything without the other.”Including their final crossing to Europe. Both boarded the boat, neither body has been found. Their mother calls me every day in hopes I will have some other news. Although Hassane and Houseine were adored in their camp in Morocco, it was difficult for me to track down their actual names for this story, because everyone there knew the charismatic young men simply as “the twins.”The Traoré brothers were not the only twins, though. Alhassane Barry, 26, from Guinea was also on board.Mamadou Saliou Bah, 23.Credit: Courtesy of the family""Hassane was the quiet one. His twin was the outgoing one. Hassane always looked up to his brother, but, in a lot of ways, it was him who the rest of us admired,” said one of his closest friends, Mamadousaliou Diallo, who made it from Morocco to Europe last year.“They lost their father when they were young, and they were both devoted to their mother. She worked so hard to be able to send them to university, and they wanted to provide a better life for her. Hassane studied sociology. He was one of the best students in his class, but when he graduated, there was no work for him. In Guinea, it doesn’t matter how smart you are. If you’re not from a wealthy family, you won’t find a good job. He didn’t tell his brother he was leaving, because he didn’t want him to worry. I was the one who called him to tell him about the tragedy. I wanted him to hear it from a friend before he saw Hassane’s photo on Facebook. He couldn’t breathe. I remember him choking back his tears, saying, how am I going to tell our mother?”Ali Keita, 27.Credit: Courtesy of the family The youngest victimsBut not everyone had a family at home waiting for news of their safe crossing. Youssouf Diallo, 16, and her little brother, 14, who was the youngest reported passenger on board, left their home after losing both of their parents. In the camps, one of the little boy’s friends tells me he cried when he realized there was no one left to notify of their death.Youssouf’s friend, Fatima Diallo, also 16, says, “I made a flower necklace and burned it in the fire last night. Youssouf and I used to make them together.”Some others had family waiting for them on the other side. Tahirou Barry, 24, from Guinea was one of them.""Junior,"" 29.Credit: Courtesy of the familyHis friend, Hady Cissé, tells me, “He had a beautiful woman waiting for him in France! She was the love of his life. They’d known each other since they were little and got married right after university. Tahirou saved up all of his money to help her get a student visa to study abroad after their wedding. They hoped to eventually both finish their studies in Europe, so they could return home and find jobs before having a family of their own. But Tahirou couldn’t wait another two years to see her, so her decided to cross through Morocco. He was counting the days until he would see her again. She didn’t know he had left.”Tidjane Bah, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the familyLike the newlyweds, Marlyatou Diallo, 26, was crossing to meet her husband, who made it to Germany last year and had fallen ill.“Marly wasn’t just my sister — she was the smartest, kindest woman I've ever known,” says Fatima, her older sister, who was watching Marly’s son for her until her return.  Her siblings passed the phone around, each sharing with me their memories of “the little one.”“She’ll be missed by all of us,” her brother, Barry, tells me, “But most of all, she’ll be missed by her husband and son, who she loved with all her heart. How can we explain to him how the world took his mother like this?”Marly’s Facebook page is filled with albums documenting every moment of her son’s life — from his first tooth to his most recent birthday — 5 years old last month.Oumou ""Belle"" Bah, 16.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThe last image she posted was perhaps an answer to her brother’s question — it read, “My son — I carried you for nine months in my body and I’ll carry you always in my heart. If there’s ever a day when I’m not beside you, know that my spirit is still there protecting you.”An incomplete listI have about 47 students in my lecture hall on Wednesday afternoons. Most of them are the same age as those smuggled across the rough waters of the Mediterranean at night. I have thought about how much attention would be devoted to remembering each of their lives if a tragedy of this proportion ever happened.Youssouf Diallo, 18.Credit: Courtesy of the familyFor the past two weeks, I have worked tirelessly collecting names and images, and yet I only have 39. There are still family members who don’t know if their loved ones are gone.Twenty-six lives will never be accounted for in official statistics because no effort was made to recover their bodies from the water. Sixteen of the 21 recovered bodies will soon be dumped in mass graves because no effort was made to identify them in the morgue.The states involved have no incentive to accurately report high death rates, and before reports can be corrected by media sources, a dozen others have occurred.Marlyatou ""Marly"" Diallo, 26.Credit: Courtesy of the familyIn the 24 hours following this tragedy, another boat carrying 39 migrants arrived safely at the Chafarinas Islands off the coast of Morocco, 94 migrants were reported dead in a capsized boat off the coat of Libya, and the Guardia Civil intercepted 31 migrants en route to Melilla. Migration across the Mediterranean is growing by the day.I hope people stop and look at the faces of Marly and Tahirou, Karim and Hassane, “the twins” and the siblings who had no parents to mourn them. I hope they see there were 47 individuals who packed what few belongings they had on their backs, handed their savings over to smugglers, and stepped onto a small wooden fishing boat to begin their lives. They were proud and eager, like students at graduation.Aminatou Diallo, 25.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBut no one was there to see all of the work it had taken for them to get to that final crossing — the thousands of miles journeyed across deserts and in the backs of trucks, the years spent sleeping on forest floors, the untold abuses suffered along the way. They stepped onto a boat carrying dreams of supporting their parents and siblings, partners and children.In all of the years I have spent working in migrant camps across North Africa, I have never met a single individual who wasn't there with the dream of helping someone else left behind. I don't think it's possible to endure the suffering they do unless you have that dream motivating you to reach the other side.Binta ""Bobo"" Baldé, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBefore the waves overthrew the boat, before he fought for one last breath, I imagine Karim was thinking of how long it might take him to save up for a real soccer ball and if the ground in Spain would feel anything like the ground at home.I hope people remember their stories the next time they read headlines about overcrowded boats and numbers, not names, of those lost at sea. The headlines never change, as if the same bodies are washing ashore again and again. But how could it be the same twins who brought music to their hidden camp, the same siblings who clung tightly to one another, the same big-hearted boy with dreams of being a soccer player?Those 47 are gone, soon to be replaced with others, proud and eager.Djenabou Bah, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the family Safourata ""Sofia"" Sow, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyKaissa Camara, 20.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAmadou Bah, 22. Credit: Courtesy of the familyAladji Abdoulaye Diallo, 27.Credit: Courtesy of the familyMamadou Aliou ""Barcley"" Bah, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThierno Bah, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAmadou Bailo Diallo, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the familyMamadou Dian Diallo, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAlpha Oumar Diallo, 19.CCredit: Courtesy of the family39 - 47 Name unknown",35.58318659,-2.795275034,Cabo Tres Forcas,Spain,PRI/PrivateSource/BBC/El Diario/Caminando/IOM/Al-M,http://bit.ly/2DuqHob,9,,,,,,,,,,,,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9,,,,,,,,,,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9,,,,,,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,4085,Klara,08/05/2018,New Entry,24/04/2018,Klara

Their mother calls me every day in hopes I will have some other news. Although Hassane and Houseine were adored in their camp in Morocco, it was difficult for me to track down their actual names for this story, because everyone there knew the charismatic young men simply as “the twins.”The Traoré brothers were not the only twins, though.

She worked so hard to be able to send them to university, and they wanted to provide a better life for her. Hassane studied sociology. He was one of the best students in his class, but when he graduated, there was no work for him. In Guinea, it doesn’t matter how smart you are. If you’re not from a wealthy family, you won’t find a good job. He didn’t tell his brother he was leaving, because he didn’t want him to worry. I was the one who called him to tell him about the tragedy. I wanted him to hear it from a friend before he saw Hassane’s photo on Facebook. He couldn’t breathe. I remember him choking back his tears, saying, how am I going to tell our mother?”Ali Keita, 27.Credit: Courtesy of the family The youngest victimsBut not everyone had a family at home waiting for news of their safe crossing. Youssouf Diallo, 16, and her little brother, 14, who was the youngest reported passenger on board, left their home after losing both of their parents. In the camps, one of the little boy’s friends tells me he cried when he realized there was no one left to notify of their death.Youssouf’s friend, Fatima Diallo, also 16, says, “I made a flower necklace and burned it in the fire last night.

Tahirou saved up all of his money to help her get a student visa to study abroad after their wedding. They hoped to eventually both finish their studies in Europe, so they could return home and find jobs before having a family of their own. But Tahirou couldn’t wait another two years to see her, so her decided to cross through Morocco. He was counting the days until he would see her again. She didn’t know he had left.”Tidjane Bah, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the familyLike the newlyweds, Marlyatou Diallo, 26, was crossing to meet her husband, who made it to Germany last year and had fallen ill.“Marly wasn’t just my sister — she was the smartest, kindest woman I've ever known,” says Fatima, her older sister, who was watching Marly’s son for her until her return.  Her siblings passed the phone around, each sharing with me their memories of “the little one.”“She’ll be missed by all of us,” her brother, Barry, tells me, “But most of all, she’ll be missed by her husband and son, who she loved with all her heart. How can we explain to him how the world took his mother like this?”Marly’s Facebook page is filled with albums documenting every moment of her son’s life — from his first tooth to his most recent birthday — 5 years old last month.Oumou ""Belle"" Bah, 16.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThe last image she posted was perhaps an answer to her brother’s question — it read, “My son — I carried you for nine months in my body and I’ll carry you always in my heart. If there’s ever a day when I’m not beside you, know that my spirit is still there protecting you.”An incomplete listI have about 47 students in my lecture hall on Wednesday afternoons. Most of them are the same age as those smuggled across the rough waters of the Mediterranean at night. I have thought about how much attention would be devoted to remembering each of their lives if a tragedy of this proportion ever happened.Youssouf Diallo, 18.Credit: Courtesy of the familyFor the past two weeks, I have worked tirelessly collecting names and images, and yet I only have 39. There are still family members who don’t know if their loved ones are gone.Twenty-six lives will never be accounted for in official statistics because no effort was made to recover their bodies from the water. Sixteen of the 21 recovered bodies will soon be dumped in mass graves because no effort was made to identify them in the morgue.The states involved have no incentive to accurately report high death rates, and before reports can be corrected by media sources, a dozen others have occurred.Marlyatou ""Marly"" Diallo, 26.Credit: Courtesy of the familyIn the 24 hours following this tragedy, another boat carrying 39 migrants arrived safely at the Chafarinas Islands off the coast of Morocco, 94 migrants were reported dead in a capsized boat off the coat of Libya, and the Guardia Civil intercepted 31 migrants en route to Melilla. Migration across the Mediterranean is growing by the day.I hope people stop and look at the faces of Marly and Tahirou, Karim and Hassane, “the twins” and the siblings who had no parents to mourn them. I hope they see there were 47 individuals who packed what few belongings they had on their backs, handed their savings over to smugglers, and stepped onto a small wooden fishing boat to begin their lives. They were proud and eager, like students at graduation.Aminatou Diallo, 25.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBut no one was there to see all of the work it had taken for them to get to that final crossing — the thousands of miles journeyed across deserts and in the backs of trucks, the years spent sleeping on forest floors, the untold abuses suffered along the way. They stepped onto a boat carrying dreams of supporting their parents and siblings, partners and children.In all of the years I have spent working in migrant camps across North Africa, I have never met a single individual who wasn't there with the dream of helping someone else left behind. I don't think it's possible to endure the suffering they do unless you have that dream motivating you to reach the other side.Binta ""Bobo"" Baldé, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBefore the waves overthrew the boat, before he fought for one last breath, I imagine Karim was thinking of how long it might take him to save up for a real soccer ball and if the ground in Spain would feel anything like the ground at home.I hope people remember their stories the next time they read headlines about overcrowded boats and numbers, not names, of those lost at sea. The headlines never change, as if the same bodies are washing ashore again and again. But how could it be the same twins who brought music to their hidden camp, the same siblings who clung tightly to one another, the same big-hearted boy with dreams of being a soccer player?Those 47 are gone, soon to be replaced with others, proud and eager.Djenabou Bah, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the family Safourata ""Sofia"" Sow, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyKaissa Camara, 20.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAmadou Bah, 22. Credit: Courtesy of the familyAladji Abdoulaye Diallo, 27.Credit: Courtesy of the familyMamadou Aliou ""Barcley"" Bah, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThierno Bah, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAmadou Bailo Diallo, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the familyMamadou Dian Diallo, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAlpha Oumar Diallo, 19.CCredit: Courtesy of the family40 - 47 Name unknown",35.58318659,-2.795275034,Cabo Tres Forcas,Spain,PRI/PrivateSource/BBC/El Diario/Caminando/IOM/Al-M,http://bit.ly/2DuqHob,1,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,4087,Dorien,08-05-2018,New Entry,24/04/2018,Dorien

For African migrants, refugees and asylum seekers seeking the chance at a better life in Europe, there are a host of smuggling options running the same routes in reverse. Most take a full day’s journey at sea and cost an average of 2,000 euros per passenger.Tahirou Barry, 22.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBoarding one of Trasmediterránea’s new ferries, you might notice a small sign warning you of seasickness. Boarding one of the small wooden fishing boats that smugglers captain from Morocco’s coast, migrants don’t need a sign warning them that, as one 15-year-old boy tells me, “You’ll make it to Europe or you’ll die trying.”A difficult processAfter being alerted to bodies floating in the open sea, Maritime Rescue sent a ship from Melilla to begin searching for survivors, and the Guardia Civil launched two smaller rescue missions as well.

Some wore life jackets. But there were a lot of life jackets without any bodies inside. At first I saw just one body, then another and another and another. It was terrible. It’s a moment I’ll never forget.”Mamadou Laly ""Le Grand"" Barry, 30.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThis is the memory of the crew member who first alerted Spanish Maritime Rescue to a capsized boat on Feb. 4. He was working on a ferry en route to Melilla, one of two Spanish enclaves still remaining in northern Africa. The ferry is part of Trasmediterránea’s large fleet and makes a daily trip between Melilla and Almería, on the Spanish mainland, carrying up to 1,250 passengers on each crossing.Some 4,000 miles away, my cell phone started ringing. I spent most of the following week on the phone with families across West Africa who were desperately searching for any information about their loved ones.Tidiane Jalloh ""TJ""  Bah, 17.Credit: Courtesy of the familyMy son, is he alive? My wife, have they found her body yet? When will we know? How will we know? Is anyone looking for them?For tourists seeking a day-trip to Morocco, there are a host of ferry options from Spain — most take 30 minutes and cost 25 euros per passenger. For African migrants, refugees and asylum seekers seeking the chance at a better life in Europe, there are a host of smuggling options running the same routes in reverse. Most take a full day’s journey at sea and cost an average of 2,000 euros per passenger.Tahirou Barry, 22.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBoarding one of Trasmediterránea’s new ferries, you might notice a small sign warning you of seasickness. Boarding one of the small wooden fishing boats that smugglers captain from Morocco’s coast, migrants don’t need a sign warning them that, as one 15-year-old boy tells me, “You’ll make it to Europe or you’ll die trying.”A difficult processAfter being alerted to bodies floating in the open sea, Maritime Rescue sent a ship from Melilla to begin searching for survivors, and the Guardia Civil launched two smaller rescue missions as well. In the hours that followed, the Royal Navy of Morocco ended up recovering the majority of the bodies, which had drifted to their coastline by the time they responded.Mohammed Diallo, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThe officers placed 20 bodies in one massive, blue plastic bag made for tragedies like this and took them to El Hassani Hospital in Nador. The one body recovered by Spanish police was taken to Melilla. At the morgue, I was told recently, 16 of the 20 bodies remain unidentified.“We have a poster hanging in the police station in Nador with pictures of each face, so the families can identify them,"" an official said.But their families aren’t in Morocco, and the friends of these victims live hidden in forest camps that are routinely under attack by Moroccan police, who threaten to beat, imprison or deport anyone found. The lack of official reporting by Spain and Morocco means family members are left with more questions than answers, often learning about the passing of loved ones from Facebook posts months after an incident has occurred.Abdul Karim Barry, 17.Credit: Courtesy of the familyA short, dangerous crossingMorocco offers the shortest passage to Europe of any African country — less than eight miles across the Mediterranean Sea — and the Spanish enclaves of Melilla and Ceuta make it the only country on the African continent to share a land border with the internally borderless EU.It is one of the most trafficked border regions in the world right now, with the number of people attempting to escape violence and poverty across West and Central Africa growing daily. The closing of other primary routes to Europe in Libya, where migrants are now being bought and sold in an emergent slave trade, is pushing more people to Morocco’s borders.Houseine Traoré, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBut the steady reinforcement of the Spain-Morocco land border, which is now secured by three rings of 20-foot high razor-wire fences and under constant surveillance by the Guardia Civil, means even more are attempting treacherous sea crossings.According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the number of migrants reaching Spain by way of the Mediterranean tripled to nearly 22,000 last year, and the number of reported drownings off the Spanish coast doubled. However, the 223 drownings reported in 2017 only account for bodies that were recovered and identified.Hassane Traoré, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyLess than two months into 2018, there have already been 75 victims recovered, including the 21 found floating off the coast of Melilla last month. How many others remain in the water?No namesThe week of the incident, major news organizations from The New York Times to El Mundo covered the latest Mediterranean tragedy, but regardless of which source you follow, you read the same facts.Alpha Moron Diallo, 23.Credit: Courtesy of the familyTwenty-one bodies. All African migrants. All packed into a small wooden fishing boat that capsized off the coast of Morocco’s Spanish enclave.There was no follow-up as the victim count edged upward, ultimately winding up more than double what was originally reported.As I followed the coverage by various sources, I noticed there was never a single name released.Who are all of these people, assigned numbers, not names, in the morgue? Where were they coming from, what had driven them to their final crossing, and what had they expected to find on the other side?Alhassane Barry, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyI needed more than a number. I didn’t want to simply break the news that it was 47 migrants and two smugglers, not 21 people, who were lost at sea. I wanted to report who had been lost. I enlisted the migrants still living in Morocco’s hidden camps to help me collect names, faces and stories. They knew better than anyone the group who left just after nightfall on Feb. 3 to walk 16 miles to the meeting point their smugglers had given them.An anthropologist by training, I started working on issues of migration and international human rights a decade ago and have spent many years living in the hundreds of makeshift camps around primary departure points in Morocco, Algeria and Libya. The first time I gained access to Carrière — one of Morocco’s largest and most tightly controlled camps — was when I was working on another story for PRI in the summer of 2016.Amoudoubailo Diallo, 20.Credit: Courtesy of the familyIt was a complicated process requiring permitting at the governmental level and clearance at the local level — from the smuggling rings that control the space and the brotherhoods of migrants themselves.I spent the following year in the region finishing a documentary film that captures the journeys of three migrants from Guinea, Mali and the DRC to their final attempted crossings. I was back in Carrière as recently as last month. In fact, I had only been back in the US for a week when I received my first phone call alerting me to the capsized boat carrying people I knew well.Bouboucar Bah, 32.Credit: Courtesy of the family'Smart, brave, generous'The photograph of Abdul Karim Barry — a 17-year-old boy from Guinea — was one of the first I saw.Karim had been in Carrière awaiting his chance at crossing for over two years. He left his home at the age of 15 and traveled more than 3,000 miles alone — from Guinea to Morocco. After his father died, he felt responsible for taking care of his younger brothers and sisters when his mother couldn’t find any way to support the family in their rural community. He wanted to give his siblings the chance to go to school like his father had given him.Ben Ali Bah, 24.Credit: Courtesy of the family“Karim was smart and brave and above all, he was generous,” one of his closest friends, Mamadou Bah, tells me over a crackling phone line. “He always struggled for the well-being of the group, even risking the dangers of going into the street to beg for us when we couldn't find enough food to eat. It was Karim who prepared the one daily meal for our brotherhood every night.”I posted a photograph of him and asked his friends in Morocco and Guinea to help me make him more than a number.“Karim studied hard before leaving home,” Thierno Jalloh wrote, “and he used his education to speak up for the other boys who didn't have any. He was young, but he was a natural leader with a big heart. He couldn’t stand for anyone to be treated as less than human because of the color of their skin.”Alpha ""Bambino"" Bah, 14.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAbdoulaye Barry wrote, “He told me he dreamed of becoming a soccer player when he was little. He played on a team in Guinea, and he was really good. But as you grow older, you realize some of your dreams won’t ever be realized. Still, Karim played with me in the forest sometimes. We had a ball we made out of plastic and tape.”Rough conditionsIn the hours before the first bodies were spotted, Karim, along with 46 men, women, and children coming from Guinea, Cote D’Ivoire, Cameroon, Senegal and Mali left their camp in Carrière. Their smugglers, two Moroccan men, were waiting for them on a rocky beach in Arekmane.Mamadou Billo Diallo, 25.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThey carried a small wooden fishing boat that had been rigged with an outboard motor down to the water. A witness who traveled with the migrants but didn’t board the boat that night said the winds were too strong for a safe crossing — 50 mph, according to official reports.So why would smugglers choose to travel, risking their own lives, under such rough conditions?In previous years, they wouldn’t have. But new systems created to protect migrants’ financial investments have made tragedies like this one significantly more likely. In 2016, I knew dozens of migrants who were devastated when they paid 1,500 to 2,500 euros and failed to reach the other side. This left them trapped in Morocco for many more years, struggling to save up enough money to try again.Amoudou Taibou Diallo, 16.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThis past summer, I noticed a niche market had emerged with some smugglers stepping into the business of transferring money from migrant to smuggler — only after they had safely reached Spanish soil. For a 10 percent increase in fee, migrants can now pay these third parties and secure their investments.Those who find themselves back in Morocco after a boat has capsized or a police vessel has re-routed them, as happens more often than not, have the money to try again.For the smugglers who captained the boat on Feb. 4, a postponed departure would have meant approximately 96,000 euros returned. Another factor: The witness explained how smugglers often call for last-minute departures when bad weather is on the horizon, knowing storms make it easier to evade surveillance efforts by the Guardia Civil.Mamadou Aliou ""Barkley"" Diallo, 34.Credit: Courtesy of the familyWith an overcrowded boat and waves reaching three meters high, they capsized less than an hour into their journey. The passengers were thrown into freezing water without enough life jackets — many of them not knowing how to swim. The oldest reported passenger on board was 34, the youngest had just turned 14. There were at least eight women, one of them pregnant.Lone survivorTwo days after the tragedy, the Royal Navy of Morocco reported that, miraculously, one young man from Mali had been found alive. After a series of interrogations, he was accused of taking part in an illegal operation and is currently being held in police custody.The Nadori police told me they are continuing to search for the top-level smugglers thought to have masterminded this operation and many others like it.Oury Diallo, 18.Credit: Courtesy of the familyPhotographs, names and questions have poured in ever since. Along with them, I received final videos that were recorded by young men like Mamadou Diallo, 21, who tells his mother, “I’ve suffered greatly in my journey to Morocco, but it’s all been worthwhile because, soon, I’ll be calling you from Spain.”And Safourata Sow, 28, who tells her three daughters how much she loves them and misses them.Again and again, I listened to the words of Karim, who was one of the last boys I interviewed in person. Sitting by his makeshift tent he tells me, “We've traveled so far, we've been through so much, I finally understand what my brothers meant when they told me, 'I'll make it to Europe or I'll die trying.' After you've endured the horrors of this journey to Morocco, there's only one way home.”Mamadou Saliou Bah, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the familyGiven the lack of access to basic social services and the active fighting in some communities in West Africa, it is not uncommon to hear of boys like Karim traveling thousands of miles north in search of a way to support their families. Hassane and Houseine Traoré — 28-year-old twin brothers from Cote D’Ivoire — had a similar story to tell.“They were the coolest guys,” says an old friend, Stephanie Dokou, who grew up with them in Cote D’Ivoire. “They were the best athletes our village had ever seen, they played music and sang, they did well in school. All the girls loved them. We knew they would go on to do great things.”Jalloh ""JJ"" Thierno Bah, 26.Credit: Courtesy of the family“They were always together,” explains another old friend, Y’souf Bella. ""One never did anything without the other.”Including their final crossing to Europe. Both boarded the boat, neither body has been found. Their mother calls me every day in hopes I will have some other news. Although Hassane and Houseine were adored in their camp in Morocco, it was difficult for me to track down their actual names for this story, because everyone there knew the charismatic young men simply as “the twins.”The Traoré brothers were not the only twins, though. Alhassane Barry, 26, from Guinea was also on board.Mamadou Saliou Bah, 23.Credit: Courtesy of the family""Hassane was the quiet one. His twin was the outgoing one.

It was Karim who prepared the one daily meal for our brotherhood every night.”I posted a photograph of him and asked his friends in Morocco and Guinea to help me make him more than a number.“Karim studied hard before leaving home,” Thierno Jalloh wrote, “and he used his education to speak up for the other boys who didn't have any.

But new systems created to protect migrants’ financial investments have made tragedies like this one significantly more likely. In 2016, I knew dozens of migrants who were devastated when they paid 1,500 to 2,500 euros and failed to reach the other side. This left them trapped in Morocco for many more years, struggling to save up enough money to try again.Amoudou Taibou Diallo, 16.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThis past summer, I noticed a niche market had emerged with some smugglers stepping into the business of transferring money from migrant to smuggler — only after they had safely reached Spanish soil.

The passengers were thrown into freezing water without enough life jackets — many of them not knowing how to swim. The oldest reported passenger on board was 34, the youngest had just turned 14. There were at least eight women, one of them pregnant.Lone survivorTwo days after the tragedy, the Royal Navy of Morocco reported that, miraculously, one young man from Mali had been found alive. After a series of interrogations, he was accused of taking part in an illegal operation and is currently being held in police custody.The Nadori police told me they are continuing to search for the top-level smugglers thought to have masterminded this operation and many others like it.Oury Diallo, 18.Credit: Courtesy of the familyPhotographs, names and questions have poured in ever since. Along with them, I received final videos that were recorded by young men like Mamadou Diallo, 21, who tells his mother, “I’ve suffered greatly in my journey to Morocco, but it’s all been worthwhile because, soon, I’ll be calling you from Spain.”And Safourata Sow, 28, who tells her three daughters how much she loves them and misses them.Again and again, I listened to the words of Karim, who was one of the last boys I interviewed in person. Sitting by his makeshift tent he tells me, “We've traveled so far, we've been through so much, I finally understand what my brothers meant when they told me, 'I'll make it to Europe or I'll die trying.' After you've endured the horrors of this journey to Morocco, there's only one way home.”Mamadou Saliou Bah, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the familyGiven the lack of access to basic social services and the active fighting in some communities in West Africa, it is not uncommon to hear of boys like Karim traveling thousands of miles north in search of a way to support their families. Hassane and Houseine Traoré — 28-year-old twin brothers from Cote D’Ivoire — had a similar story to tell.“They were the coolest guys,” says an old friend, Stephanie Dokou, who grew up with them in Cote D’Ivoire. “They were the best athletes our village had ever seen, they played music and sang, they did well in school. All the girls loved them. We knew they would go on to do great things.”Jalloh ""JJ"" Thierno Bah, 26.Credit: Courtesy of the family“They were always together,” explains another old friend, Y’souf Bella. ""One never did anything without the other.”Including their final crossing to Europe. Both boarded the boat, neither body has been found. Their mother calls me every day in hopes I will have some other news. Although Hassane and Houseine were adored in their camp in Morocco, it was difficult for me to track down their actual names for this story, because everyone there knew the charismatic young men simply as “the twins.”The Traoré brothers were not the only twins, though. Alhassane Barry, 26, from Guinea was also on board.Mamadou Saliou Bah, 23.Credit: Courtesy of the family""Hassane was the quiet one. His twin was the outgoing one. Hassane always looked up to his brother, but, in a lot of ways, it was him who the rest of us admired,” said one of his closest friends, Mamadousaliou Diallo, who made it from Morocco to Europe last year.“They lost their father when they were young, and they were both devoted to their mother. She worked so hard to be able to send them to university, and they wanted to provide a better life for her. Hassane studied sociology. He was one of the best students in his class, but when he graduated, there was no work for him. In Guinea, it doesn’t matter how smart you are. If you’re not from a wealthy family, you won’t find a good job. He didn’t tell his brother he was leaving, because he didn’t want him to worry. I was the one who called him to tell him about the tragedy. I wanted him to hear it from a friend before he saw Hassane’s photo on Facebook. He couldn’t breathe. I remember him choking back his tears, saying, how am I going to tell our mother?”Ali Keita, 27.Credit: Courtesy of the family The youngest victimsBut not everyone had a family at home waiting for news of their safe crossing. Youssouf Diallo, 16, and her little brother, 14, who was the youngest reported passenger on board, left their home after losing both of their parents. In the camps, one of the little boy’s friends tells me he cried when he realized there was no one left to notify of their death.Youssouf’s friend, Fatima Diallo, also 16, says, “I made a flower necklace and burned it in the fire last night. Youssouf and I used to make them together.”Some others had family waiting for them on the other side. Tahirou Barry, 24, from Guinea was one of them.""Junior,"" 29.Credit: Courtesy of the familyHis friend, Hady Cissé, tells me, “He had a beautiful woman waiting for him in France! She was the love of his life. They’d known each other since they were little and got married right after university. Tahirou saved up all of his money to help her get a student visa to study abroad after their wedding. They hoped to eventually both finish their studies in Europe, so they could return home and find jobs before having a family of their own. But Tahirou couldn’t wait another two years to see her, so her decided to cross through Morocco. He was counting the days until he would see her again. She didn’t know he had left.”Tidjane Bah, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the familyLike the newlyweds, Marlyatou Diallo, 26, was crossing to meet her husband, who made it to Germany last year and had fallen ill.“Marly wasn’t just my sister — she was the smartest, kindest woman I've ever known,” says Fatima, her older sister, who was watching Marly’s son for her until her return.  Her siblings passed the phone around, each sharing with me their memories of “the little one.”“She’ll be missed by all of us,” her brother, Barry, tells me, “But most of all, she’ll be missed by her husband and son, who she loved with all her heart. How can we explain to him how the world took his mother like this?”Marly’s Facebook page is filled with albums documenting every moment of her son’s life — from his first tooth to his most recent birthday — 5 years old last month.Oumou ""Belle"" Bah, 16.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThe last image she posted was perhaps an answer to her brother’s question — it read, “My son — I carried you for nine months in my body and I’ll carry you always in my heart. If there’s ever a day when I’m not beside you, know that my spirit is still there protecting you.”An incomplete listI have about 47 students in my lecture hall on Wednesday afternoons. Most of them are the same age as those smuggled across the rough waters of the Mediterranean at night. I have thought about how much attention would be devoted to remembering each of their lives if a tragedy of this proportion ever happened.Youssouf Diallo, 18.Credit: Courtesy of the familyFor the past two weeks, I have worked tirelessly collecting names and images, and yet I only have 39. There are still family members who don’t know if their loved ones are gone.Twenty-six lives will never be accounted for in official statistics because no effort was made to recover their bodies from the water. Sixteen of the 21 recovered bodies will soon be dumped in mass graves because no effort was made to identify them in the morgue.The states involved have no incentive to accurately report high death rates, and before reports can be corrected by media sources, a dozen others have occurred.Marlyatou ""Marly"" Diallo, 26.Credit: Courtesy of the familyIn the 24 hours following this tragedy, another boat carrying 39 migrants arrived safely at the Chafarinas Islands off the coast of Morocco, 94 migrants were reported dead in a capsized boat off the coat of Libya, and the Guardia Civil intercepted 31 migrants en route to Melilla. Migration across the Mediterranean is growing by the day.I hope people stop and look at the faces of Marly and Tahirou, Karim and Hassane, “the twins” and the siblings who had no parents to mourn them. I hope they see there were 47 individuals who packed what few belongings they had on their backs, handed their savings over to smugglers, and stepped onto a small wooden fishing boat to begin their lives. They were proud and eager, like students at graduation.Aminatou Diallo, 25.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBut no one was there to see all of the work it had taken for them to get to that final crossing — the thousands of miles journeyed across deserts and in the backs of trucks, the years spent sleeping on forest floors, the untold abuses suffered along the way. They stepped onto a boat carrying dreams of supporting their parents and siblings, partners and children.In all of the years I have spent working in migrant camps across North Africa, I have never met a single individual who wasn't there with the dream of helping someone else left behind. I don't think it's possible to endure the suffering they do unless you have that dream motivating you to reach the other side.Binta ""Bobo"" Baldé, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBefore the waves overthrew the boat, before he fought for one last breath, I imagine Karim was thinking of how long it might take him to save up for a real soccer ball and if the ground in Spain would feel anything like the ground at home.I hope people remember their stories the next time they read headlines about overcrowded boats and numbers, not names, of those lost at sea. The headlines never change, as if the same bodies are washing ashore again and again. But how could it be the same twins who brought music to their hidden camp, the same siblings who clung tightly to one another, the same big-hearted boy with dreams of being a soccer player?Those 47 are gone, soon to be replaced with others, proud and eager.Djenabou Bah, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the family Safourata ""Sofia"" Sow, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyKaissa Camara, 20.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAmadou Bah, 22. Credit: Courtesy of the familyAladji Abdoulaye Diallo, 27.Credit: Courtesy of the familyMamadou Aliou ""Barcley"" Bah, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThierno Bah, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAmadou Bailo Diallo, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the familyMamadou Dian Diallo, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAlpha Oumar Diallo, 19.CCredit: Courtesy of the family40 - 47 Name unknown",35.58318659,-2.795275034,Cabo Tres Forcas,Spain,PRI/PrivateSource/BBC/El Diario/Caminando/IOM/Al-M,http://bit.ly/2DuqHob,1,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,4090,Dorien,08-05-2018,New Entry,24/04/2018,Dorien

Their mother calls me every day in hopes I will have some other news. Although Hassane and Houseine were adored in their camp in Morocco, it was difficult for me to track down their actual names for this story, because everyone there knew the charismatic young men simply as “the twins.”The Traoré brothers were not the only twins, though.

She worked so hard to be able to send them to university, and they wanted to provide a better life for her. Hassane studied sociology. He was one of the best students in his class, but when he graduated, there was no work for him. In Guinea, it doesn’t matter how smart you are. If you’re not from a wealthy family, you won’t find a good job. He didn’t tell his brother he was leaving, because he didn’t want him to worry. I was the one who called him to tell him about the tragedy. I wanted him to hear it from a friend before he saw Hassane’s photo on Facebook. He couldn’t breathe.

Migration across the Mediterranean is growing by the day.I hope people stop and look at the faces of Marly and Tahirou, Karim and Hassane, “the twins” and the siblings who had no parents to mourn them.

Some wore life jackets. But there were a lot of life jackets without any bodies inside. At first I saw just one body, then another and another and another. It was terrible. It’s a moment I’ll never forget.”Mamadou Laly ""Le Grand"" Barry, 30.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThis is the memory of the crew member who first alerted Spanish Maritime Rescue to a capsized boat on Feb. 4. He was working on a ferry en route to Melilla, one of two Spanish enclaves still remaining in northern Africa. The ferry is part of Trasmediterránea’s large fleet and makes a daily trip between Melilla and Almería, on the Spanish mainland, carrying up to 1,250 passengers on each crossing.Some 4,000 miles away, my cell phone started ringing. I spent most of the following week on the phone with families across West Africa who were desperately searching for any information about their loved ones.Tidiane Jalloh ""TJ""  Bah, 17.Credit: Courtesy of the familyMy son, is he alive? My wife, have they found her body yet? When will we know? How will we know? Is anyone looking for them?For tourists seeking a day-trip to Morocco, there are a host of ferry options from Spain — most take 30 minutes and cost 25 euros per passenger. For African migrants, refugees and asylum seekers seeking the chance at a better life in Europe, there are a host of smuggling options running the same routes in reverse. Most take a full day’s journey at sea and cost an average of 2,000 euros per passenger.Tahirou Barry, 22.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBoarding one of Trasmediterránea’s new ferries, you might notice a small sign warning you of seasickness. Boarding one of the small wooden fishing boats that smugglers captain from Morocco’s coast, migrants don’t need a sign warning them that, as one 15-year-old boy tells me, “You’ll make it to Europe or you’ll die trying.”A difficult processAfter being alerted to bodies floating in the open sea, Maritime Rescue sent a ship from Melilla to begin searching for survivors, and the Guardia Civil launched two smaller rescue missions as well. In the hours that followed, the Royal Navy of Morocco ended up recovering the majority of the bodies, which had drifted to their coastline by the time they responded.Mohammed Diallo, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThe officers placed 20 bodies in one massive, blue plastic bag made for tragedies like this and took them to El Hassani Hospital in Nador. The one body recovered by Spanish police was taken to Melilla. At the morgue, I was told recently, 16 of the 20 bodies remain unidentified.“We have a poster hanging in the police station in Nador with pictures of each face, so the families can identify them,"" an official said.But their families aren’t in Morocco, and the friends of these victims live hidden in forest camps that are routinely under attack by Moroccan police, who threaten to beat, imprison or deport anyone found. The lack of official reporting by Spain and Morocco means family members are left with more questions than answers, often learning about the passing of loved ones from Facebook posts months after an incident has occurred.Abdul Karim Barry, 17.Credit: Courtesy of the familyA short, dangerous crossingMorocco offers the shortest passage to Europe of any African country — less than eight miles across the Mediterranean Sea — and the Spanish enclaves of Melilla and Ceuta make it the only country on the African continent to share a land border with the internally borderless EU.It is one of the most trafficked border regions in the world right now, with the number of people attempting to escape violence and poverty across West and Central Africa growing daily. The closing of other primary routes to Europe in Libya, where migrants are now being bought and sold in an emergent slave trade, is pushing more people to Morocco’s borders.Houseine Traoré, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBut the steady reinforcement of the Spain-Morocco land border, which is now secured by three rings of 20-foot high razor-wire fences and under constant surveillance by the Guardia Civil, means even more are attempting treacherous sea crossings.According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the number of migrants reaching Spain by way of the Mediterranean tripled to nearly 22,000 last year, and the number of reported drownings off the Spanish coast doubled. However, the 223 drownings reported in 2017 only account for bodies that were recovered and identified.Hassane Traoré, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyLess than two months into 2018, there have already been 75 victims recovered, including the 21 found floating off the coast of Melilla last month. How many others remain in the water?No namesThe week of the incident, major news organizations from The New York Times to El Mundo covered the latest Mediterranean tragedy, but regardless of which source you follow, you read the same facts.Alpha Moron Diallo, 23.Credit: Courtesy of the familyTwenty-one bodies. All African migrants. All packed into a small wooden fishing boat that capsized off the coast of Morocco’s Spanish enclave.There was no follow-up as the victim count edged upward, ultimately winding up more than double what was originally reported.As I followed the coverage by various sources, I noticed there was never a single name released.Who are all of these people, assigned numbers, not names, in the morgue? Where were they coming from, what had driven them to their final crossing, and what had they expected to find on the other side?Alhassane Barry, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyI needed more than a number. I didn’t want to simply break the news that it was 47 migrants and two smugglers, not 21 people, who were lost at sea. I wanted to report who had been lost. I enlisted the migrants still living in Morocco’s hidden camps to help me collect names, faces and stories. They knew better than anyone the group who left just after nightfall on Feb. 3 to walk 16 miles to the meeting point their smugglers had given them.An anthropologist by training, I started working on issues of migration and international human rights a decade ago and have spent many years living in the hundreds of makeshift camps around primary departure points in Morocco, Algeria and Libya. The first time I gained access to Carrière — one of Morocco’s largest and most tightly controlled camps — was when I was working on another story for PRI in the summer of 2016.Amoudoubailo Diallo, 20.Credit: Courtesy of the familyIt was a complicated process requiring permitting at the governmental level and clearance at the local level — from the smuggling rings that control the space and the brotherhoods of migrants themselves.I spent the following year in the region finishing a documentary film that captures the journeys of three migrants from Guinea, Mali and the DRC to their final attempted crossings. I was back in Carrière as recently as last month. In fact, I had only been back in the US for a week when I received my first phone call alerting me to the capsized boat carrying people I knew well.Bouboucar Bah, 32.Credit: Courtesy of the family'Smart, brave, generous'The photograph of Abdul Karim Barry — a 17-year-old boy from Guinea — was one of the first I saw.Karim had been in Carrière awaiting his chance at crossing for over two years. He left his home at the age of 15 and traveled more than 3,000 miles alone — from Guinea to Morocco. After his father died, he felt responsible for taking care of his younger brothers and sisters when his mother couldn’t find any way to support the family in their rural community. He wanted to give his siblings the chance to go to school like his father had given him.Ben Ali Bah, 24.Credit: Courtesy of the family“Karim was smart and brave and above all, he was generous,” one of his closest friends, Mamadou Bah, tells me over a crackling phone line. “He always struggled for the well-being of the group, even risking the dangers of going into the street to beg for us when we couldn't find enough food to eat. It was Karim who prepared the one daily meal for our brotherhood every night.”I posted a photograph of him and asked his friends in Morocco and Guinea to help me make him more than a number.“Karim studied hard before leaving home,” Thierno Jalloh wrote, “and he used his education to speak up for the other boys who didn't have any. He was young, but he was a natural leader with a big heart. He couldn’t stand for anyone to be treated as less than human because of the color of their skin.”Alpha ""Bambino"" Bah, 14.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAbdoulaye Barry wrote, “He told me he dreamed of becoming a soccer player when he was little. He played on a team in Guinea, and he was really good. But as you grow older, you realize some of your dreams won’t ever be realized. Still, Karim played with me in the forest sometimes. We had a ball we made out of plastic and tape.”Rough conditionsIn the hours before the first bodies were spotted, Karim, along with 46 men, women, and children coming from Guinea, Cote D’Ivoire, Cameroon, Senegal and Mali left their camp in Carrière. Their smugglers, two Moroccan men, were waiting for them on a rocky beach in Arekmane.Mamadou Billo Diallo, 25.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThey carried a small wooden fishing boat that had been rigged with an outboard motor down to the water. A witness who traveled with the migrants but didn’t board the boat that night said the winds were too strong for a safe crossing — 50 mph, according to official reports.So why would smugglers choose to travel, risking their own lives, under such rough conditions?In previous years, they wouldn’t have. But new systems created to protect migrants’ financial investments have made tragedies like this one significantly more likely. In 2016, I knew dozens of migrants who were devastated when they paid 1,500 to 2,500 euros and failed to reach the other side. This left them trapped in Morocco for many more years, struggling to save up enough money to try again.Amoudou Taibou Diallo, 16.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThis past summer, I noticed a niche market had emerged with some smugglers stepping into the business of transferring money from migrant to smuggler — only after they had safely reached Spanish soil. For a 10 percent increase in fee, migrants can now pay these third parties and secure their investments.Those who find themselves back in Morocco after a boat has capsized or a police vessel has re-routed them, as happens more often than not, have the money to try again.For the smugglers who captained the boat on Feb. 4, a postponed departure would have meant approximately 96,000 euros returned. Another factor: The witness explained how smugglers often call for last-minute departures when bad weather is on the horizon, knowing storms make it easier to evade surveillance efforts by the Guardia Civil.Mamadou Aliou ""Barkley"" Diallo, 34.Credit: Courtesy of the familyWith an overcrowded boat and waves reaching three meters high, they capsized less than an hour into their journey. The passengers were thrown into freezing water without enough life jackets — many of them not knowing how to swim. The oldest reported passenger on board was 34, the youngest had just turned 14. There were at least eight women, one of them pregnant.Lone survivorTwo days after the tragedy, the Royal Navy of Morocco reported that, miraculously, one young man from Mali had been found alive.

It’s a moment I’ll never forget.”Mamadou Laly ""Le Grand"" Barry, 30.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThis is the memory of the crew member who first alerted Spanish Maritime Rescue to a capsized boat on Feb. 4. He was working on a ferry en route to Melilla, one of two Spanish enclaves still remaining in northern Africa. The ferry is part of Trasmediterránea’s large fleet and makes a daily trip between Melilla and Almería, on the Spanish mainland, carrying up to 1,250 passengers on each crossing.Some 4,000 miles away, my cell phone started ringing. I spent most of the following week on the phone with families across West Africa who were desperately searching for any information about their loved ones.Tidiane Jalloh ""TJ""  Bah, 17.Credit: Courtesy of the familyMy son, is he alive? My wife, have they found her body yet? When will we know? How will we know? Is anyone looking for them?For tourists seeking a day-trip to Morocco, there are a host of ferry options from Spain — most take 30 minutes and cost 25 euros per passenger. For African migrants, refugees and asylum seekers seeking the chance at a better life in Europe, there are a host of smuggling options running the same routes in reverse. Most take a full day’s journey at sea and cost an average of 2,000 euros per passenger.Tahirou Barry, 22.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBoarding one of Trasmediterránea’s new ferries, you might notice a small sign warning you of seasickness. Boarding one of the small wooden fishing boats that smugglers captain from Morocco’s coast, migrants don’t need a sign warning them that, as one 15-year-old boy tells me, “You’ll make it to Europe or you’ll die trying.”A difficult processAfter being alerted to bodies floating in the open sea, Maritime Rescue sent a ship from Melilla to begin searching for survivors, and the Guardia Civil launched two smaller rescue missions as well. In the hours that followed, the Royal Navy of Morocco ended up recovering the majority of the bodies, which had drifted to their coastline by the time they responded.Mohammed Diallo, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThe officers placed 20 bodies in one massive, blue plastic bag made for tragedies like this and took them to El Hassani Hospital in Nador. The one body recovered by Spanish police was taken to Melilla. At the morgue, I was told recently, 16 of the 20 bodies remain unidentified.“We have a poster hanging in the police station in Nador with pictures of each face, so the families can identify them,"" an official said.But their families aren’t in Morocco, and the friends of these victims live hidden in forest camps that are routinely under attack by Moroccan police, who threaten to beat, imprison or deport anyone found. The lack of official reporting by Spain and Morocco means family members are left with more questions than answers, often learning about the passing of loved ones from Facebook posts months after an incident has occurred.Abdul Karim Barry, 17.Credit: Courtesy of the familyA short, dangerous crossingMorocco offers the shortest passage to Europe of any African country — less than eight miles across the Mediterranean Sea — and the Spanish enclaves of Melilla and Ceuta make it the only country on the African continent to share a land border with the internally borderless EU.It is one of the most trafficked border regions in the world right now, with the number of people attempting to escape violence and poverty across West and Central Africa growing daily. The closing of other primary routes to Europe in Libya, where migrants are now being bought and sold in an emergent slave trade, is pushing more people to Morocco’s borders.Houseine Traoré, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBut the steady reinforcement of the Spain-Morocco land border, which is now secured by three rings of 20-foot high razor-wire fences and under constant surveillance by the Guardia Civil, means even more are attempting treacherous sea crossings.According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the number of migrants reaching Spain by way of the Mediterranean tripled to nearly 22,000 last year, and the number of reported drownings off the Spanish coast doubled. However, the 223 drownings reported in 2017 only account for bodies that were recovered and identified.Hassane Traoré, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyLess than two months into 2018, there have already been 75 victims recovered, including the 21 found floating off the coast of Melilla last month.

I didn’t want to simply break the news that it was 47 migrants and two smugglers, not 21 people, who were lost at sea. I wanted to report who had been lost. I enlisted the migrants still living in Morocco’s hidden camps to help me collect names, faces and stories. They knew better than anyone the group who left just after nightfall on Feb. 3 to walk 16 miles to the meeting point their smugglers had given them.An anthropologist by training, I started working on issues of migration and international human rights a decade ago and have spent many years living in the hundreds of makeshift camps around primary departure points in Morocco, Algeria and Libya. The first time I gained access to Carrière — one of Morocco’s largest and most tightly controlled camps — was when I was working on another story for PRI in the summer of 2016.Amoudoubailo Diallo, 20.Credit: Courtesy of the familyIt was a complicated process requiring permitting at the governmental level and clearance at the local level — from the smuggling rings that control the space and the brotherhoods of migrants themselves.I spent the following year in the region finishing a documentary film that captures the journeys of three migrants from Guinea, Mali and the DRC to their final attempted crossings. I was back in Carrière as recently as last month. In fact, I had only been back in the US for a week when I received my first phone call alerting me to the capsized boat carrying people I knew well.Bouboucar Bah, 32.Credit: Courtesy of the family'Smart, brave, generous'The photograph of Abdul Karim Barry — a 17-year-old boy from Guinea — was one of the first I saw.Karim had been in Carrière awaiting his chance at crossing for over two years. He left his home at the age of 15 and traveled more than 3,000 miles alone — from Guinea to Morocco. After his father died, he felt responsible for taking care of his younger brothers and sisters when his mother couldn’t find any way to support the family in their rural community. He wanted to give his siblings the chance to go to school like his father had given him.Ben Ali Bah, 24.Credit: Courtesy of the family“Karim was smart and brave and above all, he was generous,” one of his closest friends, Mamadou Bah, tells me over a crackling phone line. “He always struggled for the well-being of the group, even risking the dangers of going into the street to beg for us when we couldn't find enough food to eat. It was Karim who prepared the one daily meal for our brotherhood every night.”I posted a photograph of him and asked his friends in Morocco and Guinea to help me make him more than a number.“Karim studied hard before leaving home,” Thierno Jalloh wrote, “and he used his education to speak up for the other boys who didn't have any. He was young, but he was a natural leader with a big heart. He couldn’t stand for anyone to be treated as less than human because of the color of their skin.”Alpha ""Bambino"" Bah, 14.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAbdoulaye Barry wrote, “He told me he dreamed of becoming a soccer player when he was little. He played on a team in Guinea, and he was really good. But as you grow older, you realize some of your dreams won’t ever be realized. Still, Karim played with me in the forest sometimes. We had a ball we made out of plastic and tape.”Rough conditionsIn the hours before the first bodies were spotted, Karim, along with 46 men, women, and children coming from Guinea, Cote D’Ivoire, Cameroon, Senegal and Mali left their camp in Carrière. Their smugglers, two Moroccan men, were waiting for them on a rocky beach in Arekmane.Mamadou Billo Diallo, 25.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThey carried a small wooden fishing boat that had been rigged with an outboard motor down to the water. A witness who traveled with the migrants but didn’t board the boat that night said the winds were too strong for a safe crossing — 50 mph, according to official reports.So why would smugglers choose to travel, risking their own lives, under such rough conditions?In previous years, they wouldn’t have. But new systems created to protect migrants’ financial investments have made tragedies like this one significantly more likely. In 2016, I knew dozens of migrants who were devastated when they paid 1,500 to 2,500 euros and failed to reach the other side. This left them trapped in Morocco for many more years, struggling to save up enough money to try again.Amoudou Taibou Diallo, 16.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThis past summer, I noticed a niche market had emerged with some smugglers stepping into the business of transferring money from migrant to smuggler — only after they had safely reached Spanish soil. For a 10 percent increase in fee, migrants can now pay these third parties and secure their investments.Those who find themselves back in Morocco after a boat has capsized or a police vessel has re-routed them, as happens more often than not, have the money to try again.For the smugglers who captained the boat on Feb. 4, a postponed departure would have meant approximately 96,000 euros returned. Another factor: The witness explained how smugglers often call for last-minute departures when bad weather is on the horizon, knowing storms make it easier to evade surveillance efforts by the Guardia Civil.Mamadou Aliou ""Barkley"" Diallo, 34.Credit: Courtesy of the familyWith an overcrowded boat and waves reaching three meters high, they capsized less than an hour into their journey. The passengers were thrown into freezing water without enough life jackets — many of them not knowing how to swim. The oldest reported passenger on board was 34, the youngest had just turned 14. There were at least eight women, one of them pregnant.Lone survivorTwo days after the tragedy, the Royal Navy of Morocco reported that, miraculously, one young man from Mali had been found alive. After a series of interrogations, he was accused of taking part in an illegal operation and is currently being held in police custody.The Nadori police told me they are continuing to search for the top-level smugglers thought to have masterminded this operation and many others like it.Oury Diallo, 18.Credit: Courtesy of the familyPhotographs, names and questions have poured in ever since. Along with them, I received final videos that were recorded by young men like Mamadou Diallo, 21, who tells his mother, “I’ve suffered greatly in my journey to Morocco, but it’s all been worthwhile because, soon, I’ll be calling you from Spain.”And Safourata Sow, 28, who tells her three daughters how much she loves them and misses them.Again and again, I listened to the words of Karim, who was one of the last boys I interviewed in person. Sitting by his makeshift tent he tells me, “We've traveled so far, we've been through so much, I finally understand what my brothers meant when they told me, 'I'll make it to Europe or I'll die trying.' After you've endured the horrors of this journey to Morocco, there's only one way home.”Mamadou Saliou Bah, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the familyGiven the lack of access to basic social services and the active fighting in some communities in West Africa, it is not uncommon to hear of boys like Karim traveling thousands of miles north in search of a way to support their families. Hassane and Houseine Traoré — 28-year-old twin brothers from Cote D’Ivoire — had a similar story to tell.“They were the coolest guys,” says an old friend, Stephanie Dokou, who grew up with them in Cote D’Ivoire. “They were the best athletes our village had ever seen, they played music and sang, they did well in school. All the girls loved them. We knew they would go on to do great things.”Jalloh ""JJ"" Thierno Bah, 26.Credit: Courtesy of the family“They were always together,” explains another old friend, Y’souf Bella. ""One never did anything without the other.”Including their final crossing to Europe. Both boarded the boat, neither body has been found. Their mother calls me every day in hopes I will have some other news. Although Hassane and Houseine were adored in their camp in Morocco, it was difficult for me to track down their actual names for this story, because everyone there knew the charismatic young men simply as “the twins.”The Traoré brothers were not the only twins, though. Alhassane Barry, 26, from Guinea was also on board.Mamadou Saliou Bah, 23.Credit: Courtesy of the family""Hassane was the quiet one. His twin was the outgoing one. Hassane always looked up to his brother, but, in a lot of ways, it was him who the rest of us admired,” said one of his closest friends, Mamadousaliou Diallo, who made it from Morocco to Europe last year.“They lost their father when they were young, and they were both devoted to their mother. She worked so hard to be able to send them to university, and they wanted to provide a better life for her. Hassane studied sociology. He was one of the best students in his class, but when he graduated, there was no work for him. In Guinea, it doesn’t matter how smart you are. If you’re not from a wealthy family, you won’t find a good job. He didn’t tell his brother he was leaving, because he didn’t want him to worry. I was the one who called him to tell him about the tragedy. I wanted him to hear it from a friend before he saw Hassane’s photo on Facebook. He couldn’t breathe. I remember him choking back his tears, saying, how am I going to tell our mother?”Ali Keita, 27.Credit: Courtesy of the family The youngest victimsBut not everyone had a family at home waiting for news of their safe crossing. Youssouf Diallo, 16, and her little brother, 14, who was the youngest reported passenger on board, left their home after losing both of their parents. In the camps, one of the little boy’s friends tells me he cried when he realized there was no one left to notify of their death.Youssouf’s friend, Fatima Diallo, also 16, says, “I made a flower necklace and burned it in the fire last night. Youssouf and I used to make them together.”Some others had family waiting for them on the other side. Tahirou Barry, 24, from Guinea was one of them.""Junior,"" 29.Credit: Courtesy of the familyHis friend, Hady Cissé, tells me, “He had a beautiful woman waiting for him in France! She was the love of his life. They’d known each other since they were little and got married right after university. Tahirou saved up all of his money to help her get a student visa to study abroad after their wedding. They hoped to eventually both finish their studies in Europe, so they could return home and find jobs before having a family of their own. But Tahirou couldn’t wait another two years to see her, so her decided to cross through Morocco. He was counting the days until he would see her again. She didn’t know he had left.”Tidjane Bah, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the familyLike the newlyweds, Marlyatou Diallo, 26, was crossing to meet her husband, who made it to Germany last year and had fallen ill.“Marly wasn’t just my sister — she was the smartest, kindest woman I've ever known,” says Fatima, her older sister, who was watching Marly’s son for her until her return.  Her siblings passed the phone around, each sharing with me their memories of “the little one.”“She’ll be missed by all of us,” her brother, Barry, tells me, “But most of all, she’ll be missed by her husband and son, who she loved with all her heart. How can we explain to him how the world took his mother like this?”Marly’s Facebook page is filled with albums documenting every moment of her son’s life — from his first tooth to his most recent birthday — 5 years old last month.Oumou ""Belle"" Bah, 16.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThe last image she posted was perhaps an answer to her brother’s question — it read, “My son — I carried you for nine months in my body and I’ll carry you always in my heart. If there’s ever a day when I’m not beside you, know that my spirit is still there protecting you.”An incomplete listI have about 47 students in my lecture hall on Wednesday afternoons. Most of them are the same age as those smuggled across the rough waters of the Mediterranean at night. I have thought about how much attention would be devoted to remembering each of their lives if a tragedy of this proportion ever happened.Youssouf Diallo, 18.Credit: Courtesy of the familyFor the past two weeks, I have worked tirelessly collecting names and images, and yet I only have 39. There are still family members who don’t know if their loved ones are gone.Twenty-six lives will never be accounted for in official statistics because no effort was made to recover their bodies from the water. Sixteen of the 21 recovered bodies will soon be dumped in mass graves because no effort was made to identify them in the morgue.The states involved have no incentive to accurately report high death rates, and before reports can be corrected by media sources, a dozen others have occurred.Marlyatou ""Marly"" Diallo, 26.Credit: Courtesy of the familyIn the 24 hours following this tragedy, another boat carrying 39 migrants arrived safely at the Chafarinas Islands off the coast of Morocco, 94 migrants were reported dead in a capsized boat off the coat of Libya, and the Guardia Civil intercepted 31 migrants en route to Melilla. Migration across the Mediterranean is growing by the day.I hope people stop and look at the faces of Marly and Tahirou, Karim and Hassane, “the twins” and the siblings who had no parents to mourn them. I hope they see there were 47 individuals who packed what few belongings they had on their backs, handed their savings over to smugglers, and stepped onto a small wooden fishing boat to begin their lives. They were proud and eager, like students at graduation.Aminatou Diallo, 25.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBut no one was there to see all of the work it had taken for them to get to that final crossing — the thousands of miles journeyed across deserts and in the backs of trucks, the years spent sleeping on forest floors, the untold abuses suffered along the way. They stepped onto a boat carrying dreams of supporting their parents and siblings, partners and children.In all of the years I have spent working in migrant camps across North Africa, I have never met a single individual who wasn't there with the dream of helping someone else left behind. I don't think it's possible to endure the suffering they do unless you have that dream motivating you to reach the other side.Binta ""Bobo"" Baldé, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBefore the waves overthrew the boat, before he fought for one last breath, I imagine Karim was thinking of how long it might take him to save up for a real soccer ball and if the ground in Spain would feel anything like the ground at home.I hope people remember their stories the next time they read headlines about overcrowded boats and numbers, not names, of those lost at sea. The headlines never change, as if the same bodies are washing ashore again and again. But how could it be the same twins who brought music to their hidden camp, the same siblings who clung tightly to one another, the same big-hearted boy with dreams of being a soccer player?Those 47 are gone, soon to be replaced with others, proud and eager.Djenabou Bah, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the family Safourata ""Sofia"" Sow, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyKaissa Camara, 20.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAmadou Bah, 22. Credit: Courtesy of the familyAladji Abdoulaye Diallo, 27.Credit: Courtesy of the familyMamadou Aliou ""Barcley"" Bah, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThierno Bah, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAmadou Bailo Diallo, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the familyMamadou Dian Diallo, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAlpha Oumar Diallo, 19.CCredit: Courtesy of the family40 - 47 Name unknown",35.58318659,-2.795275034,Cabo Tres Forcas,Spain,PRI/PrivateSource/BBC/El Diario/Caminando/IOM/Al-M,http://bit.ly/2DuqHob,1,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,4093,Dorien,08-05-2018,New Entry,24/04/2018,Dorien

I have thought about how much attention would be devoted to remembering each of their lives if a tragedy of this proportion ever happened.Youssouf Diallo, 18.Credit: Courtesy of the familyFor the past two weeks, I have worked tirelessly collecting names and images, and yet I only have 39. There are still family members who don’t know if their loved ones are gone.Twenty-six lives will never be accounted for in official statistics because no effort was made to recover their bodies from the water. Sixteen of the 21 recovered bodies will soon be dumped in mass graves because no effort was made to identify them in the morgue.The states involved have no incentive to accurately report high death rates, and before reports can be corrected by media sources, a dozen others have occurred.Marlyatou ""Marly"" Diallo, 26.Credit: Courtesy of the familyIn the 24 hours following this tragedy, another boat carrying 39 migrants arrived safely at the Chafarinas Islands off the coast of Morocco, 94 migrants were reported dead in a capsized boat off the coat of Libya, and the Guardia Civil intercepted 31 migrants en route to Melilla. Migration across the Mediterranean is growing by the day.I hope people stop and look at the faces of Marly and Tahirou, Karim and Hassane, “the twins” and the siblings who had no parents to mourn them. I hope they see there were 47 individuals who packed what few belongings they had on their backs, handed their savings over to smugglers, and stepped onto a small wooden fishing boat to begin their lives. They were proud and eager, like students at graduation.Aminatou Diallo, 25.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBut no one was there to see all of the work it had taken for them to get to that final crossing — the thousands of miles journeyed across deserts and in the backs of trucks, the years spent sleeping on forest floors, the untold abuses suffered along the way. They stepped onto a boat carrying dreams of supporting their parents and siblings, partners and children.In all of the years I have spent working in migrant camps across North Africa, I have never met a single individual who wasn't there with the dream of helping someone else left behind. I don't think it's possible to endure the suffering they do unless you have that dream motivating you to reach the other side.Binta ""Bobo"" Baldé, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBefore the waves overthrew the boat, before he fought for one last breath, I imagine Karim was thinking of how long it might take him to save up for a real soccer ball and if the ground in Spain would feel anything like the ground at home.I hope people remember their stories the next time they read headlines about overcrowded boats and numbers, not names, of those lost at sea. The headlines never change, as if the same bodies are washing ashore again and again. But how could it be the same twins who brought music to their hidden camp, the same siblings who clung tightly to one another, the same big-hearted boy with dreams of being a soccer player?Those 47 are gone, soon to be replaced with others, proud and eager.Djenabou Bah, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the family Safourata ""Sofia"" Sow, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyKaissa Camara, 20.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAmadou Bah, 22. Credit: Courtesy of the familyAladji Abdoulaye Diallo, 27.Credit: Courtesy of the familyMamadou Aliou ""Barcley"" Bah, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThierno Bah, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAmadou Bailo Diallo, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the familyMamadou Dian Diallo, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAlpha Oumar Diallo, 19.CCredit: Courtesy of the family40 - 47 Name unknown",35.58318659,-2.795275034,Cabo Tres Forcas,Spain,PRI/PrivateSource/BBC/El Diario/Caminando/IOM/Al-M,http://bit.ly/2DuqHob,1,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,4094,Dorien,08-05-2018,New Entry,24/04/2018,Dorien

He was working on a ferry en route to Melilla, one of two Spanish enclaves still remaining in northern Africa. The ferry is part of Trasmediterránea’s large fleet and makes a daily trip between Melilla and Almería, on the Spanish mainland, carrying up to 1,250 passengers on each crossing.Some 4,000 miles away, my cell phone started ringing. I spent most of the following week on the phone with families across West Africa who were desperately searching for any information about their loved ones.Tidiane Jalloh ""TJ""  Bah, 17.Credit: Courtesy of the familyMy son, is he alive? My wife, have they found her body yet? When will we know? How will we know? Is anyone looking for them?For tourists seeking a day-trip to Morocco, there are a host of ferry options from Spain — most take 30 minutes and cost 25 euros per passenger. For African migrants, refugees and asylum seekers seeking the chance at a better life in Europe, there are a host of smuggling options running the same routes in reverse. Most take a full day’s journey at sea and cost an average of 2,000 euros per passenger.Tahirou Barry, 22.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBoarding one of Trasmediterránea’s new ferries, you might notice a small sign warning you of seasickness. Boarding one of the small wooden fishing boats that smugglers captain from Morocco’s coast, migrants don’t need a sign warning them that, as one 15-year-old boy tells me, “You’ll make it to Europe or you’ll die trying.”A difficult processAfter being alerted to bodies floating in the open sea, Maritime Rescue sent a ship from Melilla to begin searching for survivors, and the Guardia Civil launched two smaller rescue missions as well. In the hours that followed, the Royal Navy of Morocco ended up recovering the majority of the bodies, which had drifted to their coastline by the time they responded.Mohammed Diallo, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThe officers placed 20 bodies in one massive, blue plastic bag made for tragedies like this and took them to El Hassani Hospital in Nador. The one body recovered by Spanish police was taken to Melilla. At the morgue, I was told recently, 16 of the 20 bodies remain unidentified.“We have a poster hanging in the police station in Nador with pictures of each face, so the families can identify them,"" an official said.But their families aren’t in Morocco, and the friends of these victims live hidden in forest camps that are routinely under attack by Moroccan police, who threaten to beat, imprison or deport anyone found. The lack of official reporting by Spain and Morocco means family members are left with more questions than answers, often learning about the passing of loved ones from Facebook posts months after an incident has occurred.Abdul Karim Barry, 17.Credit: Courtesy of the familyA short, dangerous crossingMorocco offers the shortest passage to Europe of any African country — less than eight miles across the Mediterranean Sea — and the Spanish enclaves of Melilla and Ceuta make it the only country on the African continent to share a land border with the internally borderless EU.It is one of the most trafficked border regions in the world right now, with the number of people attempting to escape violence and poverty across West and Central Africa growing daily. The closing of other primary routes to Europe in Libya, where migrants are now being bought and sold in an emergent slave trade, is pushing more people to Morocco’s borders.Houseine Traoré, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBut the steady reinforcement of the Spain-Morocco land border, which is now secured by three rings of 20-foot high razor-wire fences and under constant surveillance by the Guardia Civil, means even more are attempting treacherous sea crossings.According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the number of migrants reaching Spain by way of the Mediterranean tripled to nearly 22,000 last year, and the number of reported drownings off the Spanish coast doubled. However, the 223 drownings reported in 2017 only account for bodies that were recovered and identified.Hassane Traoré, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyLess than two months into 2018, there have already been 75 victims recovered, including the 21 found floating off the coast of Melilla last month.

Where were they coming from, what had driven them to their final crossing, and what had they expected to find on the other side?Alhassane Barry, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyI needed more than a number. I didn’t want to simply break the news that it was 47 migrants and two smugglers, not 21 people, who were lost at sea. I wanted to report who had been lost. I enlisted the migrants still living in Morocco’s hidden camps to help me collect names, faces and stories. They knew better than anyone the group who left just after nightfall on Feb. 3 to walk 16 miles to the meeting point their smugglers had given them.An anthropologist by training, I started working on issues of migration and international human rights a decade ago and have spent many years living in the hundreds of makeshift camps around primary departure points in Morocco, Algeria and Libya.

He was working on a ferry en route to Melilla, one of two Spanish enclaves still remaining in northern Africa. The ferry is part of Trasmediterránea’s large fleet and makes a daily trip between Melilla and Almería, on the Spanish mainland, carrying up to 1,250 passengers on each crossing.Some 4,000 miles away, my cell phone started ringing.

My wife, have they found her body yet? When will we know? How will we know?

For African migrants, refugees and asylum seekers seeking the chance at a better life in Europe, there are a host of smuggling options running the same routes in reverse. Most take a full day’s journey at sea and cost an average of 2,000 euros per passenger.Tahirou Barry, 22.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBoarding one of Trasmediterránea’s new ferries, you might notice a small sign warning you of seasickness. Boarding one of the small wooden fishing boats that smugglers captain from Morocco’s coast, migrants don’t need a sign warning them that, as one 15-year-old boy tells me, “You’ll make it to Europe or you’ll die trying.”A difficult processAfter being alerted to bodies floating in the open sea, Maritime Rescue sent a ship from Melilla to begin searching for survivors, and the Guardia Civil launched two smaller rescue missions as well. In the hours that followed, the Royal Navy of Morocco ended up recovering the majority of the bodies, which had drifted to their coastline by the time they responded.Mohammed Diallo, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThe officers placed 20 bodies in one massive, blue plastic bag made for tragedies like this and took them to El Hassani Hospital in Nador.

The lack of official reporting by Spain and Morocco means family members are left with more questions than answers, often learning about the passing of loved ones from Facebook posts months after an incident has occurred.Abdul Karim Barry, 17.Credit: Courtesy of the familyA short, dangerous crossingMorocco offers the shortest passage to Europe of any African country — less than eight miles across the Mediterranean Sea — and the Spanish enclaves of Melilla and Ceuta make it the only country on the African continent to share a land border with the internally borderless EU.It is one of the most trafficked border regions in the world right now, with the number of people attempting to escape violence and poverty across West and Central Africa growing daily. The closing of other primary routes to Europe in Libya, where migrants are now being bought and sold in an emergent slave trade, is pushing more people to Morocco’s borders.Houseine Traoré, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBut the steady reinforcement of the Spain-Morocco land border, which is now secured by three rings of 20-foot high razor-wire fences and under constant surveillance by the Guardia Civil, means even more are attempting treacherous sea crossings.According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the number of migrants reaching Spain by way of the Mediterranean tripled to nearly 22,000 last year, and the number of reported drownings off the Spanish coast doubled. However, the 223 drownings reported in 2017 only account for bodies that were recovered and identified.Hassane Traoré, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyLess than two months into 2018, there have already been 75 victims recovered, including the 21 found floating off the coast of Melilla last month.

All African migrants. All packed into a small wooden fishing boat that capsized off the coast of Morocco’s Spanish enclave.There was no follow-up as the victim count edged upward, ultimately winding up more than double what was originally reported.As I followed the coverage by various sources, I noticed there was never a single name released.Who are all of these people, assigned numbers, not names, in the morgue? Where were they coming from, what had driven them to their final crossing, and what had they expected to find on the other side?Alhassane Barry, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyI needed more than a number. I didn’t want to simply break the news that it was 47 migrants and two smugglers, not 21 people, who were lost at sea. I wanted to report who had been lost. I enlisted the migrants still living in Morocco’s hidden camps to help me collect names, faces and stories. They knew better than anyone the group who left just after nightfall on Feb. 3 to walk 16 miles to the meeting point their smugglers had given them.An anthropologist by training, I started working on issues of migration and international human rights a decade ago and have spent many years living in the hundreds of makeshift camps around primary departure points in Morocco, Algeria and Libya. The first time I gained access to Carrière — one of Morocco’s largest and most tightly controlled camps — was when I was working on another story for PRI in the summer of 2016.Amoudoubailo Diallo, 20.Credit: Courtesy of the familyIt was a complicated process requiring permitting at the governmental level and clearance at the local level — from the smuggling rings that control the space and the brotherhoods of migrants themselves.I spent the following year in the region finishing a documentary film that captures the journeys of three migrants from Guinea, Mali and the DRC to their final attempted crossings. I was back in Carrière as recently as last month. In fact, I had only been back in the US for a week when I received my first phone call alerting me to the capsized boat carrying people I knew well.Bouboucar Bah, 32.Credit: Courtesy of the family'Smart, brave, generous'The photograph of Abdul Karim Barry — a 17-year-old boy from Guinea — was one of the first I saw.Karim had been in Carrière awaiting his chance at crossing for over two years. He left his home at the age of 15 and traveled more than 3,000 miles alone — from Guinea to Morocco. After his father died, he felt responsible for taking care of his younger brothers and sisters when his mother couldn’t find any way to support the family in their rural community. He wanted to give his siblings the chance to go to school like his father had given him.Ben Ali Bah, 24.Credit: Courtesy of the family“Karim was smart and brave and above all, he was generous,” one of his closest friends, Mamadou Bah, tells me over a crackling phone line. “He always struggled for the well-being of the group, even risking the dangers of going into the street to beg for us when we couldn't find enough food to eat. It was Karim who prepared the one daily meal for our brotherhood every night.”I posted a photograph of him and asked his friends in Morocco and Guinea to help me make him more than a number.“Karim studied hard before leaving home,” Thierno Jalloh wrote, “and he used his education to speak up for the other boys who didn't have any. He was young, but he was a natural leader with a big heart. He couldn’t stand for anyone to be treated as less than human because of the color of their skin.”Alpha ""Bambino"" Bah, 14.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAbdoulaye Barry wrote, “He told me he dreamed of becoming a soccer player when he was little. He played on a team in Guinea, and he was really good. But as you grow older, you realize some of your dreams won’t ever be realized. Still, Karim played with me in the forest sometimes. We had a ball we made out of plastic and tape.”Rough conditionsIn the hours before the first bodies were spotted, Karim, along with 46 men, women, and children coming from Guinea, Cote D’Ivoire, Cameroon, Senegal and Mali left their camp in Carrière. Their smugglers, two Moroccan men, were waiting for them on a rocky beach in Arekmane.Mamadou Billo Diallo, 25.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThey carried a small wooden fishing boat that had been rigged with an outboard motor down to the water. A witness who traveled with the migrants but didn’t board the boat that night said the winds were too strong for a safe crossing — 50 mph, according to official reports.So why would smugglers choose to travel, risking their own lives, under such rough conditions?In previous years, they wouldn’t have. But new systems created to protect migrants’ financial investments have made tragedies like this one significantly more likely. In 2016, I knew dozens of migrants who were devastated when they paid 1,500 to 2,500 euros and failed to reach the other side. This left them trapped in Morocco for many more years, struggling to save up enough money to try again.Amoudou Taibou Diallo, 16.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThis past summer, I noticed a niche market had emerged with some smugglers stepping into the business of transferring money from migrant to smuggler — only after they had safely reached Spanish soil. For a 10 percent increase in fee, migrants can now pay these third parties and secure their investments.Those who find themselves back in Morocco after a boat has capsized or a police vessel has re-routed them, as happens more often than not, have the money to try again.For the smugglers who captained the boat on Feb. 4, a postponed departure would have meant approximately 96,000 euros returned. Another factor: The witness explained how smugglers often call for last-minute departures when bad weather is on the horizon, knowing storms make it easier to evade surveillance efforts by the Guardia Civil.Mamadou Aliou ""Barkley"" Diallo, 34.Credit: Courtesy of the familyWith an overcrowded boat and waves reaching three meters high, they capsized less than an hour into their journey. The passengers were thrown into freezing water without enough life jackets — many of them not knowing how to swim. The oldest reported passenger on board was 34, the youngest had just turned 14. There were at least eight women, one of them pregnant.Lone survivorTwo days after the tragedy, the Royal Navy of Morocco reported that, miraculously, one young man from Mali had been found alive. After a series of interrogations, he was accused of taking part in an illegal operation and is currently being held in police custody.The Nadori police told me they are continuing to search for the top-level smugglers thought to have masterminded this operation and many others like it.Oury Diallo, 18.Credit: Courtesy of the familyPhotographs, names and questions have poured in ever since. Along with them, I received final videos that were recorded by young men like Mamadou Diallo, 21, who tells his mother, “I’ve suffered greatly in my journey to Morocco, but it’s all been worthwhile because, soon, I’ll be calling you from Spain.”And Safourata Sow, 28, who tells her three daughters how much she loves them and misses them.Again and again, I listened to the words of Karim, who was one of the last boys I interviewed in person. Sitting by his makeshift tent he tells me, “We've traveled so far, we've been through so much, I finally understand what my brothers meant when they told me, 'I'll make it to Europe or I'll die trying.' After you've endured the horrors of this journey to Morocco, there's only one way home.”Mamadou Saliou Bah, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the familyGiven the lack of access to basic social services and the active fighting in some communities in West Africa, it is not uncommon to hear of boys like Karim traveling thousands of miles north in search of a way to support their families. Hassane and Houseine Traoré — 28-year-old twin brothers from Cote D’Ivoire — had a similar story to tell.“They were the coolest guys,” says an old friend, Stephanie Dokou, who grew up with them in Cote D’Ivoire. “They were the best athletes our village had ever seen, they played music and sang, they did well in school. All the girls loved them. We knew they would go on to do great things.”Jalloh ""JJ"" Thierno Bah, 26.Credit: Courtesy of the family“They were always together,” explains another old friend, Y’souf Bella. ""One never did anything without the other.”Including their final crossing to Europe. Both boarded the boat, neither body has been found. Their mother calls me every day in hopes I will have some other news. Although Hassane and Houseine were adored in their camp in Morocco, it was difficult for me to track down their actual names for this story, because everyone there knew the charismatic young men simply as “the twins.”The Traoré brothers were not the only twins, though. Alhassane Barry, 26, from Guinea was also on board.Mamadou Saliou Bah, 23.Credit: Courtesy of the family""Hassane was the quiet one. His twin was the outgoing one. Hassane always looked up to his brother, but, in a lot of ways, it was him who the rest of us admired,” said one of his closest friends, Mamadousaliou Diallo, who made it from Morocco to Europe last year.“They lost their father when they were young, and they were both devoted to their mother. She worked so hard to be able to send them to university, and they wanted to provide a better life for her. Hassane studied sociology. He was one of the best students in his class, but when he graduated, there was no work for him. In Guinea, it doesn’t matter how smart you are. If you’re not from a wealthy family, you won’t find a good job. He didn’t tell his brother he was leaving, because he didn’t want him to worry. I was the one who called him to tell him about the tragedy. I wanted him to hear it from a friend before he saw Hassane’s photo on Facebook. He couldn’t breathe. I remember him choking back his tears, saying, how am I going to tell our mother?”Ali Keita, 27.Credit: Courtesy of the family The youngest victimsBut not everyone had a family at home waiting for news of their safe crossing. Youssouf Diallo, 16, and her little brother, 14, who was the youngest reported passenger on board, left their home after losing both of their parents. In the camps, one of the little boy’s friends tells me he cried when he realized there was no one left to notify of their death.Youssouf’s friend, Fatima Diallo, also 16, says, “I made a flower necklace and burned it in the fire last night. Youssouf and I used to make them together.”Some others had family waiting for them on the other side. Tahirou Barry, 24, from Guinea was one of them.""Junior,"" 29.Credit: Courtesy of the familyHis friend, Hady Cissé, tells me, “He had a beautiful woman waiting for him in France! She was the love of his life. They’d known each other since they were little and got married right after university. Tahirou saved up all of his money to help her get a student visa to study abroad after their wedding. They hoped to eventually both finish their studies in Europe, so they could return home and find jobs before having a family of their own. But Tahirou couldn’t wait another two years to see her, so her decided to cross through Morocco. He was counting the days until he would see her again. She didn’t know he had left.”Tidjane Bah, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the familyLike the newlyweds, Marlyatou Diallo, 26, was crossing to meet her husband, who made it to Germany last year and had fallen ill.“Marly wasn’t just my sister — she was the smartest, kindest woman I've ever known,” says Fatima, her older sister, who was watching Marly’s son for her until her return.  Her siblings passed the phone around, each sharing with me their memories of “the little one.”“She’ll be missed by all of us,” her brother, Barry, tells me, “But most of all, she’ll be missed by her husband and son, who she loved with all her heart. How can we explain to him how the world took his mother like this?”Marly’s Facebook page is filled with albums documenting every moment of her son’s life — from his first tooth to his most recent birthday — 5 years old last month.Oumou ""Belle"" Bah, 16.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThe last image she posted was perhaps an answer to her brother’s question — it read, “My son — I carried you for nine months in my body and I’ll carry you always in my heart. If there’s ever a day when I’m not beside you, know that my spirit is still there protecting you.”An incomplete listI have about 47 students in my lecture hall on Wednesday afternoons.

They hoped to eventually both finish their studies in Europe, so they could return home and find jobs before having a family of their own. But Tahirou couldn’t wait another two years to see her, so her decided to cross through Morocco. He was counting the days until he would see her again. She didn’t know he had left.”Tidjane Bah, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the familyLike the newlyweds, Marlyatou Diallo, 26, was crossing to meet her husband, who made it to Germany last year and had fallen ill.“Marly wasn’t just my sister — she was the smartest, kindest woman I've ever known,” says Fatima, her older sister, who was watching Marly’s son for her until her return.  Her siblings passed the phone around, each sharing with me their memories of “the little one.”“She’ll be missed by all of us,” her brother, Barry, tells me, “But most of all, she’ll be missed by her husband and son, who she loved with all her heart. How can we explain to him how the world took his mother like this?”Marly’s Facebook page is filled with albums documenting every moment of her son’s life — from his first tooth to his most recent birthday — 5 years old last month.Oumou ""Belle"" Bah, 16.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThe last image she posted was perhaps an answer to her brother’s question — it read, “My son — I carried you for nine months in my body and I’ll carry you always in my heart. If there’s ever a day when I’m not beside you, know that my spirit is still there protecting you.”An incomplete listI have about 47 students in my lecture hall on Wednesday afternoons. Most of them are the same age as those smuggled across the rough waters of the Mediterranean at night. I have thought about how much attention would be devoted to remembering each of their lives if a tragedy of this proportion ever happened.Youssouf Diallo, 18.Credit: Courtesy of the familyFor the past two weeks, I have worked tirelessly collecting names and images, and yet I only have 39. There are still family members who don’t know if their loved ones are gone.Twenty-six lives will never be accounted for in official statistics because no effort was made to recover their bodies from the water. Sixteen of the 21 recovered bodies will soon be dumped in mass graves because no effort was made to identify them in the morgue.The states involved have no incentive to accurately report high death rates, and before reports can be corrected by media sources, a dozen others have occurred.Marlyatou ""Marly"" Diallo, 26.Credit: Courtesy of the familyIn the 24 hours following this tragedy, another boat carrying 39 migrants arrived safely at the Chafarinas Islands off the coast of Morocco, 94 migrants were reported dead in a capsized boat off the coat of Libya, and the Guardia Civil intercepted 31 migrants en route to Melilla. Migration across the Mediterranean is growing by the day.I hope people stop and look at the faces of Marly and Tahirou, Karim and Hassane, “the twins” and the siblings who had no parents to mourn them. I hope they see there were 47 individuals who packed what few belongings they had on their backs, handed their savings over to smugglers, and stepped onto a small wooden fishing boat to begin their lives. They were proud and eager, like students at graduation.Aminatou Diallo, 25.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBut no one was there to see all of the work it had taken for them to get to that final crossing — the thousands of miles journeyed across deserts and in the backs of trucks, the years spent sleeping on forest floors, the untold abuses suffered along the way. They stepped onto a boat carrying dreams of supporting their parents and siblings, partners and children.In all of the years I have spent working in migrant camps across North Africa, I have never met a single individual who wasn't there with the dream of helping someone else left behind. I don't think it's possible to endure the suffering they do unless you have that dream motivating you to reach the other side.Binta ""Bobo"" Baldé, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBefore the waves overthrew the boat, before he fought for one last breath, I imagine Karim was thinking of how long it might take him to save up for a real soccer ball and if the ground in Spain would feel anything like the ground at home.I hope people remember their stories the next time they read headlines about overcrowded boats and numbers, not names, of those lost at sea. The headlines never change, as if the same bodies are washing ashore again and again. But how could it be the same twins who brought music to their hidden camp, the same siblings who clung tightly to one another, the same big-hearted boy with dreams of being a soccer player?Those 47 are gone, soon to be replaced with others, proud and eager.Djenabou Bah, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the family Safourata ""Sofia"" Sow, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyKaissa Camara, 20.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAmadou Bah, 22. Credit: Courtesy of the familyAladji Abdoulaye Diallo, 27.Credit: Courtesy of the familyMamadou Aliou ""Barcley"" Bah, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThierno Bah, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAmadou Bailo Diallo, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the familyMamadou Dian Diallo, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAlpha Oumar Diallo, 19.CCredit: Courtesy of the family40 - 47 Name unknown",35.58318659,-2.795275034,Cabo Tres Forcas,Spain,PRI/PrivateSource/BBC/El Diario/Caminando/IOM/Al-M,http://bit.ly/2DuqHob,1,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,4097,Dorien,08-05-2018,New Entry,24/04/2018,Dorien

He was working on a ferry en route to Melilla, one of two Spanish enclaves still remaining in northern Africa. The ferry is part of Trasmediterránea’s large fleet and makes a daily trip between Melilla and Almería, on the Spanish mainland, carrying up to 1,250 passengers on each crossing.Some 4,000 miles away, my cell phone started ringing.

My wife, have they found her body yet? When will we know? How will we know? Is anyone looking for them?For tourists seeking a day-trip to Morocco, there are a host of ferry options from Spain — most take 30 minutes and cost 25 euros per passenger. For African migrants, refugees and asylum seekers seeking the chance at a better life in Europe, there are a host of smuggling options running the same routes in reverse. Most take a full day’s journey at sea and cost an average of 2,000 euros per passenger.Tahirou Barry, 22.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBoarding one of Trasmediterránea’s new ferries, you might notice a small sign warning you of seasickness. Boarding one of the small wooden fishing boats that smugglers captain from Morocco’s coast, migrants don’t need a sign warning them that, as one 15-year-old boy tells me, “You’ll make it to Europe or you’ll die trying.”A difficult processAfter being alerted to bodies floating in the open sea, Maritime Rescue sent a ship from Melilla to begin searching for survivors, and the Guardia Civil launched two smaller rescue missions as well. In the hours that followed, the Royal Navy of Morocco ended up recovering the majority of the bodies, which had drifted to their coastline by the time they responded.Mohammed Diallo, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThe officers placed 20 bodies in one massive, blue plastic bag made for tragedies like this and took them to El Hassani Hospital in Nador. The one body recovered by Spanish police was taken to Melilla. At the morgue, I was told recently, 16 of the 20 bodies remain unidentified.“We have a poster hanging in the police station in Nador with pictures of each face, so the families can identify them,"" an official said.But their families aren’t in Morocco, and the friends of these victims live hidden in forest camps that are routinely under attack by Moroccan police, who threaten to beat, imprison or deport anyone found. The lack of official reporting by Spain and Morocco means family members are left with more questions than answers, often learning about the passing of loved ones from Facebook posts months after an incident has occurred.Abdul Karim Barry, 17.Credit: Courtesy of the familyA short, dangerous crossingMorocco offers the shortest passage to Europe of any African country — less than eight miles across the Mediterranean Sea — and the Spanish enclaves of Melilla and Ceuta make it the only country on the African continent to share a land border with the internally borderless EU.It is one of the most trafficked border regions in the world right now, with the number of people attempting to escape violence and poverty across West and Central Africa growing daily. The closing of other primary routes to Europe in Libya, where migrants are now being bought and sold in an emergent slave trade, is pushing more people to Morocco’s borders.Houseine Traoré, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBut the steady reinforcement of the Spain-Morocco land border, which is now secured by three rings of 20-foot high razor-wire fences and under constant surveillance by the Guardia Civil, means even more are attempting treacherous sea crossings.According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the number of migrants reaching Spain by way of the Mediterranean tripled to nearly 22,000 last year, and the number of reported drownings off the Spanish coast doubled. However, the 223 drownings reported in 2017 only account for bodies that were recovered and identified.Hassane Traoré, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyLess than two months into 2018, there have already been 75 victims recovered, including the 21 found floating off the coast of Melilla last month.

Some wore life jackets. But there were a lot of life jackets without any bodies inside. At first I saw just one body, then another and another and another. It was terrible. It’s a moment I’ll never forget.”Mamadou Laly ""Le Grand"" Barry, 30.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThis is the memory of the crew member who first alerted Spanish Maritime Rescue to a capsized boat on Feb. 4. He was working on a ferry en route to Melilla, one of two Spanish enclaves still remaining in northern Africa. The ferry is part of Trasmediterránea’s large fleet and makes a daily trip between Melilla and Almería, on the Spanish mainland, carrying up to 1,250 passengers on each crossing.Some 4,000 miles away, my cell phone started ringing. I spent most of the following week on the phone with families across West Africa who were desperately searching for any information about their loved ones.Tidiane Jalloh ""TJ""  Bah, 17.Credit: Courtesy of the familyMy son, is he alive? My wife, have they found her body yet? When will we know? How will we know? Is anyone looking for them?For tourists seeking a day-trip to Morocco, there are a host of ferry options from Spain — most take 30 minutes and cost 25 euros per passenger. For African migrants, refugees and asylum seekers seeking the chance at a better life in Europe, there are a host of smuggling options running the same routes in reverse. Most take a full day’s journey at sea and cost an average of 2,000 euros per passenger.Tahirou Barry, 22.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBoarding one of Trasmediterránea’s new ferries, you might notice a small sign warning you of seasickness. Boarding one of the small wooden fishing boats that smugglers captain from Morocco’s coast, migrants don’t need a sign warning them that, as one 15-year-old boy tells me, “You’ll make it to Europe or you’ll die trying.”A difficult processAfter being alerted to bodies floating in the open sea, Maritime Rescue sent a ship from Melilla to begin searching for survivors, and the Guardia Civil launched two smaller rescue missions as well. In the hours that followed, the Royal Navy of Morocco ended up recovering the majority of the bodies, which had drifted to their coastline by the time they responded.Mohammed Diallo, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThe officers placed 20 bodies in one massive, blue plastic bag made for tragedies like this and took them to El Hassani Hospital in Nador. The one body recovered by Spanish police was taken to Melilla. At the morgue, I was told recently, 16 of the 20 bodies remain unidentified.“We have a poster hanging in the police station in Nador with pictures of each face, so the families can identify them,"" an official said.But their families aren’t in Morocco, and the friends of these victims live hidden in forest camps that are routinely under attack by Moroccan police, who threaten to beat, imprison or deport anyone found. The lack of official reporting by Spain and Morocco means family members are left with more questions than answers, often learning about the passing of loved ones from Facebook posts months after an incident has occurred.Abdul Karim Barry, 17.Credit: Courtesy of the familyA short, dangerous crossingMorocco offers the shortest passage to Europe of any African country — less than eight miles across the Mediterranean Sea — and the Spanish enclaves of Melilla and Ceuta make it the only country on the African continent to share a land border with the internally borderless EU.It is one of the most trafficked border regions in the world right now, with the number of people attempting to escape violence and poverty across West and Central Africa growing daily. The closing of other primary routes to Europe in Libya, where migrants are now being bought and sold in an emergent slave trade, is pushing more people to Morocco’s borders.Houseine Traoré, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBut the steady reinforcement of the Spain-Morocco land border, which is now secured by three rings of 20-foot high razor-wire fences and under constant surveillance by the Guardia Civil, means even more are attempting treacherous sea crossings.According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the number of migrants reaching Spain by way of the Mediterranean tripled to nearly 22,000 last year, and the number of reported drownings off the Spanish coast doubled. However, the 223 drownings reported in 2017 only account for bodies that were recovered and identified.Hassane Traoré, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyLess than two months into 2018, there have already been 75 victims recovered, including the 21 found floating off the coast of Melilla last month. How many others remain in the water?No namesThe week of the incident, major news organizations from The New York Times to El Mundo covered the latest Mediterranean tragedy, but regardless of which source you follow, you read the same facts.Alpha Moron Diallo, 23.Credit: Courtesy of the familyTwenty-one bodies. All African migrants. All packed into a small wooden fishing boat that capsized off the coast of Morocco’s Spanish enclave.There was no follow-up as the victim count edged upward, ultimately winding up more than double what was originally reported.As I followed the coverage by various sources, I noticed there was never a single name released.Who are all of these people, assigned numbers, not names, in the morgue? Where were they coming from, what had driven them to their final crossing, and what had they expected to find on the other side?Alhassane Barry, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyI needed more than a number. I didn’t want to simply break the news that it was 47 migrants and two smugglers, not 21 people, who were lost at sea. I wanted to report who had been lost. I enlisted the migrants still living in Morocco’s hidden camps to help me collect names, faces and stories. They knew better than anyone the group who left just after nightfall on Feb. 3 to walk 16 miles to the meeting point their smugglers had given them.An anthropologist by training, I started working on issues of migration and international human rights a decade ago and have spent many years living in the hundreds of makeshift camps around primary departure points in Morocco, Algeria and Libya. The first time I gained access to Carrière — one of Morocco’s largest and most tightly controlled camps — was when I was working on another story for PRI in the summer of 2016.Amoudoubailo Diallo, 20.Credit: Courtesy of the familyIt was a complicated process requiring permitting at the governmental level and clearance at the local level — from the smuggling rings that control the space and the brotherhoods of migrants themselves.I spent the following year in the region finishing a documentary film that captures the journeys of three migrants from Guinea, Mali and the DRC to their final attempted crossings. I was back in Carrière as recently as last month. In fact, I had only been back in the US for a week when I received my first phone call alerting me to the capsized boat carrying people I knew well.Bouboucar Bah, 32.Credit: Courtesy of the family'Smart, brave, generous'The photograph of Abdul Karim Barry — a 17-year-old boy from Guinea — was one of the first I saw.Karim had been in Carrière awaiting his chance at crossing for over two years. He left his home at the age of 15 and traveled more than 3,000 miles alone — from Guinea to Morocco. After his father died, he felt responsible for taking care of his younger brothers and sisters when his mother couldn’t find any way to support the family in their rural community. He wanted to give his siblings the chance to go to school like his father had given him.Ben Ali Bah, 24.Credit: Courtesy of the family“Karim was smart and brave and above all, he was generous,” one of his closest friends, Mamadou Bah, tells me over a crackling phone line. “He always struggled for the well-being of the group, even risking the dangers of going into the street to beg for us when we couldn't find enough food to eat. It was Karim who prepared the one daily meal for our brotherhood every night.”I posted a photograph of him and asked his friends in Morocco and Guinea to help me make him more than a number.“Karim studied hard before leaving home,” Thierno Jalloh wrote, “and he used his education to speak up for the other boys who didn't have any. He was young, but he was a natural leader with a big heart. He couldn’t stand for anyone to be treated as less than human because of the color of their skin.”Alpha ""Bambino"" Bah, 14.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAbdoulaye Barry wrote, “He told me he dreamed of becoming a soccer player when he was little. He played on a team in Guinea, and he was really good. But as you grow older, you realize some of your dreams won’t ever be realized. Still, Karim played with me in the forest sometimes. We had a ball we made out of plastic and tape.”Rough conditionsIn the hours before the first bodies were spotted, Karim, along with 46 men, women, and children coming from Guinea, Cote D’Ivoire, Cameroon, Senegal and Mali left their camp in Carrière. Their smugglers, two Moroccan men, were waiting for them on a rocky beach in Arekmane.Mamadou Billo Diallo, 25.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThey carried a small wooden fishing boat that had been rigged with an outboard motor down to the water. A witness who traveled with the migrants but didn’t board the boat that night said the winds were too strong for a safe crossing — 50 mph, according to official reports.So why would smugglers choose to travel, risking their own lives, under such rough conditions?In previous years, they wouldn’t have. But new systems created to protect migrants’ financial investments have made tragedies like this one significantly more likely. In 2016, I knew dozens of migrants who were devastated when they paid 1,500 to 2,500 euros and failed to reach the other side. This left them trapped in Morocco for many more years, struggling to save up enough money to try again.Amoudou Taibou Diallo, 16.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThis past summer, I noticed a niche market had emerged with some smugglers stepping into the business of transferring money from migrant to smuggler — only after they had safely reached Spanish soil. For a 10 percent increase in fee, migrants can now pay these third parties and secure their investments.Those who find themselves back in Morocco after a boat has capsized or a police vessel has re-routed them, as happens more often than not, have the money to try again.For the smugglers who captained the boat on Feb. 4, a postponed departure would have meant approximately 96,000 euros returned. Another factor: The witness explained how smugglers often call for last-minute departures when bad weather is on the horizon, knowing storms make it easier to evade surveillance efforts by the Guardia Civil.Mamadou Aliou ""Barkley"" Diallo, 34.Credit: Courtesy of the familyWith an overcrowded boat and waves reaching three meters high, they capsized less than an hour into their journey. The passengers were thrown into freezing water without enough life jackets — many of them not knowing how to swim. The oldest reported passenger on board was 34, the youngest had just turned 14. There were at least eight women, one of them pregnant.Lone survivorTwo days after the tragedy, the Royal Navy of Morocco reported that, miraculously, one young man from Mali had been found alive. After a series of interrogations, he was accused of taking part in an illegal operation and is currently being held in police custody.The Nadori police told me they are continuing to search for the top-level smugglers thought to have masterminded this operation and many others like it.Oury Diallo, 18.Credit: Courtesy of the familyPhotographs, names and questions have poured in ever since. Along with them, I received final videos that were recorded by young men like Mamadou Diallo, 21, who tells his mother, “I’ve suffered greatly in my journey to Morocco, but it’s all been worthwhile because, soon, I’ll be calling you from Spain.”And Safourata Sow, 28, who tells her three daughters how much she loves them and misses them.Again and again, I listened to the words of Karim, who was one of the last boys I interviewed in person. Sitting by his makeshift tent he tells me, “We've traveled so far, we've been through so much, I finally understand what my brothers meant when they told me, 'I'll make it to Europe or I'll die trying.' After you've endured the horrors of this journey to Morocco, there's only one way home.”Mamadou Saliou Bah, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the familyGiven the lack of access to basic social services and the active fighting in some communities in West Africa, it is not uncommon to hear of boys like Karim traveling thousands of miles north in search of a way to support their families. Hassane and Houseine Traoré — 28-year-old twin brothers from Cote D’Ivoire — had a similar story to tell.“They were the coolest guys,” says an old friend, Stephanie Dokou, who grew up with them in Cote D’Ivoire. “They were the best athletes our village had ever seen, they played music and sang, they did well in school. All the girls loved them. We knew they would go on to do great things.”Jalloh ""JJ"" Thierno Bah, 26.Credit: Courtesy of the family“They were always together,” explains another old friend, Y’souf Bella. ""One never did anything without the other.”Including their final crossing to Europe. Both boarded the boat, neither body has been found. Their mother calls me every day in hopes I will have some other news. Although Hassane and Houseine were adored in their camp in Morocco, it was difficult for me to track down their actual names for this story, because everyone there knew the charismatic young men simply as “the twins.”The Traoré brothers were not the only twins, though. Alhassane Barry, 26, from Guinea was also on board.Mamadou Saliou Bah, 23.Credit: Courtesy of the family""Hassane was the quiet one. His twin was the outgoing one. Hassane always looked up to his brother, but, in a lot of ways, it was him who the rest of us admired,” said one of his closest friends, Mamadousaliou Diallo, who made it from Morocco to Europe last year.“They lost their father when they were young, and they were both devoted to their mother. She worked so hard to be able to send them to university, and they wanted to provide a better life for her. Hassane studied sociology. He was one of the best students in his class, but when he graduated, there was no work for him. In Guinea, it doesn’t matter how smart you are. If you’re not from a wealthy family, you won’t find a good job. He didn’t tell his brother he was leaving, because he didn’t want him to worry. I was the one who called him to tell him about the tragedy. I wanted him to hear it from a friend before he saw Hassane’s photo on Facebook. He couldn’t breathe. I remember him choking back his tears, saying, how am I going to tell our mother?”Ali Keita, 27.Credit: Courtesy of the family The youngest victimsBut not everyone had a family at home waiting for news of their safe crossing. Youssouf Diallo, 16, and her little brother, 14, who was the youngest reported passenger on board, left their home after losing both of their parents. In the camps, one of the little boy’s friends tells me he cried when he realized there was no one left to notify of their death.Youssouf’s friend, Fatima Diallo, also 16, says, “I made a flower necklace and burned it in the fire last night.

The closing of other primary routes to Europe in Libya, where migrants are now being bought and sold in an emergent slave trade, is pushing more people to Morocco’s borders.Houseine Traoré, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBut the steady reinforcement of the Spain-Morocco land border, which is now secured by three rings of 20-foot high razor-wire fences and under constant surveillance by the Guardia Civil, means even more are attempting treacherous sea crossings.According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the number of migrants reaching Spain by way of the Mediterranean tripled to nearly 22,000 last year, and the number of reported drownings off the Spanish coast doubled.

He left his home at the age of 15 and traveled more than 3,000 miles alone — from Guinea to Morocco. After his father died, he felt responsible for taking care of his younger brothers and sisters when his mother couldn’t find any way to support the family in their rural community. He wanted to give his siblings the chance to go to school like his father had given him.Ben Ali Bah, 24.Credit: Courtesy of the family“Karim was smart and brave and above all, he was generous,” one of his closest friends, Mamadou Bah, tells me over a crackling phone line. “He always struggled for the well-being of the group, even risking the dangers of going into the street to beg for us when we couldn't find enough food to eat. It was Karim who prepared the one daily meal for our brotherhood every night.”I posted a photograph of him and asked his friends in Morocco and Guinea to help me make him more than a number.“Karim studied hard before leaving home,” Thierno Jalloh wrote, “and he used his education to speak up for the other boys who didn't have any.

We had a ball we made out of plastic and tape.”Rough conditionsIn the hours before the first bodies were spotted, Karim, along with 46 men, women, and children coming from Guinea, Cote D’Ivoire, Cameroon, Senegal and Mali left their camp in Carrière. Their smugglers, two Moroccan men, were waiting for them on a rocky beach in Arekmane.Mamadou Billo Diallo, 25.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThey carried a small wooden fishing boat that had been rigged with an outboard motor down to the water. A witness who traveled with the migrants but didn’t board the boat that night said the winds were too strong for a safe crossing — 50 mph, according to official reports.So why would smugglers choose to travel, risking their own lives, under such rough conditions?In previous years, they wouldn’t have. But new systems created to protect migrants’ financial investments have made tragedies like this one significantly more likely. In 2016, I knew dozens of migrants who were devastated when they paid 1,500 to 2,500 euros and failed to reach the other side. This left them trapped in Morocco for many more years, struggling to save up enough money to try again.Amoudou Taibou Diallo, 16.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThis past summer, I noticed a niche market had emerged with some smugglers stepping into the business of transferring money from migrant to smuggler — only after they had safely reached Spanish soil.

The passengers were thrown into freezing water without enough life jackets — many of them not knowing how to swim. The oldest reported passenger on board was 34, the youngest had just turned 14. There were at least eight women, one of them pregnant.Lone survivorTwo days after the tragedy, the Royal Navy of Morocco reported that, miraculously, one young man from Mali had been found alive. After a series of interrogations, he was accused of taking part in an illegal operation and is currently being held in police custody.The Nadori police told me they are continuing to search for the top-level smugglers thought to have masterminded this operation and many others like it.Oury Diallo, 18.Credit: Courtesy of the familyPhotographs, names and questions have poured in ever since. Along with them, I received final videos that were recorded by young men like Mamadou Diallo, 21, who tells his mother, “I’ve suffered greatly in my journey to Morocco, but it’s all been worthwhile because, soon, I’ll be calling you from Spain.”And Safourata Sow, 28, who tells her three daughters how much she loves them and misses them.Again and again, I listened to the words of Karim, who was one of the last boys I interviewed in person. Sitting by his makeshift tent he tells me, “We've traveled so far, we've been through so much, I finally understand what my brothers meant when they told me, 'I'll make it to Europe or I'll die trying.' After you've endured the horrors of this journey to Morocco, there's only one way home.”Mamadou Saliou Bah, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the familyGiven the lack of access to basic social services and the active fighting in some communities in West Africa, it is not uncommon to hear of boys like Karim traveling thousands of miles north in search of a way to support their families. Hassane and Houseine Traoré — 28-year-old twin brothers from Cote D’Ivoire — had a similar story to tell.“They were the coolest guys,” says an old friend, Stephanie Dokou, who grew up with them in Cote D’Ivoire. “They were the best athletes our village had ever seen, they played music and sang, they did well in school. All the girls loved them. We knew they would go on to do great things.”Jalloh ""JJ"" Thierno Bah, 26.Credit: Courtesy of the family“They were always together,” explains another old friend, Y’souf Bella. ""One never did anything without the other.”Including their final crossing to Europe. Both boarded the boat, neither body has been found. Their mother calls me every day in hopes I will have some other news. Although Hassane and Houseine were adored in their camp in Morocco, it was difficult for me to track down their actual names for this story, because everyone there knew the charismatic young men simply as “the twins.”The Traoré brothers were not the only twins, though. Alhassane Barry, 26, from Guinea was also on board.Mamadou Saliou Bah, 23.Credit: Courtesy of the family""Hassane was the quiet one. His twin was the outgoing one. Hassane always looked up to his brother, but, in a lot of ways, it was him who the rest of us admired,” said one of his closest friends, Mamadousaliou Diallo, who made it from Morocco to Europe last year.“They lost their father when they were young, and they were both devoted to their mother. She worked so hard to be able to send them to university, and they wanted to provide a better life for her. Hassane studied sociology. He was one of the best students in his class, but when he graduated, there was no work for him. In Guinea, it doesn’t matter how smart you are. If you’re not from a wealthy family, you won’t find a good job. He didn’t tell his brother he was leaving, because he didn’t want him to worry. I was the one who called him to tell him about the tragedy. I wanted him to hear it from a friend before he saw Hassane’s photo on Facebook. He couldn’t breathe. I remember him choking back his tears, saying, how am I going to tell our mother?”Ali Keita, 27.Credit: Courtesy of the family The youngest victimsBut not everyone had a family at home waiting for news of their safe crossing. Youssouf Diallo, 16, and her little brother, 14, who was the youngest reported passenger on board, left their home after losing both of their parents. In the camps, one of the little boy’s friends tells me he cried when he realized there was no one left to notify of their death.Youssouf’s friend, Fatima Diallo, also 16, says, “I made a flower necklace and burned it in the fire last night. Youssouf and I used to make them together.”Some others had family waiting for them on the other side. Tahirou Barry, 24, from Guinea was one of them.""Junior,"" 29.Credit: Courtesy of the familyHis friend, Hady Cissé, tells me, “He had a beautiful woman waiting for him in France! She was the love of his life. They’d known each other since they were little and got married right after university. Tahirou saved up all of his money to help her get a student visa to study abroad after their wedding. They hoped to eventually both finish their studies in Europe, so they could return home and find jobs before having a family of their own. But Tahirou couldn’t wait another two years to see her, so her decided to cross through Morocco. He was counting the days until he would see her again. She didn’t know he had left.”Tidjane Bah, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the familyLike the newlyweds, Marlyatou Diallo, 26, was crossing to meet her husband, who made it to Germany last year and had fallen ill.“Marly wasn’t just my sister — she was the smartest, kindest woman I've ever known,” says Fatima, her older sister, who was watching Marly’s son for her until her return.  Her siblings passed the phone around, each sharing with me their memories of “the little one.”“She’ll be missed by all of us,” her brother, Barry, tells me, “But most of all, she’ll be missed by her husband and son, who she loved with all her heart. How can we explain to him how the world took his mother like this?”Marly’s Facebook page is filled with albums documenting every moment of her son’s life — from his first tooth to his most recent birthday — 5 years old last month.Oumou ""Belle"" Bah, 16.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThe last image she posted was perhaps an answer to her brother’s question — it read, “My son — I carried you for nine months in my body and I’ll carry you always in my heart. If there’s ever a day when I’m not beside you, know that my spirit is still there protecting you.”An incomplete listI have about 47 students in my lecture hall on Wednesday afternoons. Most of them are the same age as those smuggled across the rough waters of the Mediterranean at night. I have thought about how much attention would be devoted to remembering each of their lives if a tragedy of this proportion ever happened.Youssouf Diallo, 18.Credit: Courtesy of the familyFor the past two weeks, I have worked tirelessly collecting names and images, and yet I only have 39. There are still family members who don’t know if their loved ones are gone.Twenty-six lives will never be accounted for in official statistics because no effort was made to recover their bodies from the water. Sixteen of the 21 recovered bodies will soon be dumped in mass graves because no effort was made to identify them in the morgue.The states involved have no incentive to accurately report high death rates, and before reports can be corrected by media sources, a dozen others have occurred.Marlyatou ""Marly"" Diallo, 26.Credit: Courtesy of the familyIn the 24 hours following this tragedy, another boat carrying 39 migrants arrived safely at the Chafarinas Islands off the coast of Morocco, 94 migrants were reported dead in a capsized boat off the coat of Libya, and the Guardia Civil intercepted 31 migrants en route to Melilla. Migration across the Mediterranean is growing by the day.I hope people stop and look at the faces of Marly and Tahirou, Karim and Hassane, “the twins” and the siblings who had no parents to mourn them. I hope they see there were 47 individuals who packed what few belongings they had on their backs, handed their savings over to smugglers, and stepped onto a small wooden fishing boat to begin their lives. They were proud and eager, like students at graduation.Aminatou Diallo, 25.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBut no one was there to see all of the work it had taken for them to get to that final crossing — the thousands of miles journeyed across deserts and in the backs of trucks, the years spent sleeping on forest floors, the untold abuses suffered along the way. They stepped onto a boat carrying dreams of supporting their parents and siblings, partners and children.In all of the years I have spent working in migrant camps across North Africa, I have never met a single individual who wasn't there with the dream of helping someone else left behind. I don't think it's possible to endure the suffering they do unless you have that dream motivating you to reach the other side.Binta ""Bobo"" Baldé, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBefore the waves overthrew the boat, before he fought for one last breath, I imagine Karim was thinking of how long it might take him to save up for a real soccer ball and if the ground in Spain would feel anything like the ground at home.I hope people remember their stories the next time they read headlines about overcrowded boats and numbers, not names, of those lost at sea. The headlines never change, as if the same bodies are washing ashore again and again. But how could it be the same twins who brought music to their hidden camp, the same siblings who clung tightly to one another, the same big-hearted boy with dreams of being a soccer player?Those 47 are gone, soon to be replaced with others, proud and eager.Djenabou Bah, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the family Safourata ""Sofia"" Sow, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyKaissa Camara, 20.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAmadou Bah, 22. Credit: Courtesy of the familyAladji Abdoulaye Diallo, 27.Credit: Courtesy of the familyMamadou Aliou ""Barcley"" Bah, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThierno Bah, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAmadou Bailo Diallo, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the familyMamadou Dian Diallo, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAlpha Oumar Diallo, 19.CCredit: Courtesy of the family40 - 47 Name unknown",35.58318659,-2.795275034,Cabo Tres Forcas,Spain,PRI/PrivateSource/BBC/El Diario/Caminando/IOM/Al-M,http://bit.ly/2DuqHob,1,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,4100,Dorien,08-05-2018,New Entry,24/04/2018,Dorien

She worked so hard to be able to send them to university, and they wanted to provide a better life for her. Hassane studied sociology. He was one of the best students in his class, but when he graduated, there was no work for him. In Guinea, it doesn’t matter how smart you are. If you’re not from a wealthy family, you won’t find a good job. He didn’t tell his brother he was leaving, because he didn’t want him to worry. I was the one who called him to tell him about the tragedy. I wanted him to hear it from a friend before he saw Hassane’s photo on Facebook. He couldn’t breathe.

Some wore life jackets. But there were a lot of life jackets without any bodies inside. At first I saw just one body, then another and another and another. It was terrible. It’s a moment I’ll never forget.”Mamadou Laly ""Le Grand"" Barry, 30.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThis is the memory of the crew member who first alerted Spanish Maritime Rescue to a capsized boat on Feb. 4. He was working on a ferry en route to Melilla, one of two Spanish enclaves still remaining in northern Africa. The ferry is part of Trasmediterránea’s large fleet and makes a daily trip between Melilla and Almería, on the Spanish mainland, carrying up to 1,250 passengers on each crossing.Some 4,000 miles away, my cell phone started ringing. I spent most of the following week on the phone with families across West Africa who were desperately searching for any information about their loved ones.Tidiane Jalloh ""TJ""  Bah, 17.Credit: Courtesy of the familyMy son, is he alive? My wife, have they found her body yet? When will we know? How will we know? Is anyone looking for them?For tourists seeking a day-trip to Morocco, there are a host of ferry options from Spain — most take 30 minutes and cost 25 euros per passenger. For African migrants, refugees and asylum seekers seeking the chance at a better life in Europe, there are a host of smuggling options running the same routes in reverse. Most take a full day’s journey at sea and cost an average of 2,000 euros per passenger.Tahirou Barry, 22.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBoarding one of Trasmediterránea’s new ferries, you might notice a small sign warning you of seasickness. Boarding one of the small wooden fishing boats that smugglers captain from Morocco’s coast, migrants don’t need a sign warning them that, as one 15-year-old boy tells me, “You’ll make it to Europe or you’ll die trying.”A difficult processAfter being alerted to bodies floating in the open sea, Maritime Rescue sent a ship from Melilla to begin searching for survivors, and the Guardia Civil launched two smaller rescue missions as well. In the hours that followed, the Royal Navy of Morocco ended up recovering the majority of the bodies, which had drifted to their coastline by the time they responded.Mohammed Diallo, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThe officers placed 20 bodies in one massive, blue plastic bag made for tragedies like this and took them to El Hassani Hospital in Nador. The one body recovered by Spanish police was taken to Melilla. At the morgue, I was told recently, 16 of the 20 bodies remain unidentified.“We have a poster hanging in the police station in Nador with pictures of each face, so the families can identify them,"" an official said.But their families aren’t in Morocco, and the friends of these victims live hidden in forest camps that are routinely under attack by Moroccan police, who threaten to beat, imprison or deport anyone found. The lack of official reporting by Spain and Morocco means family members are left with more questions than answers, often learning about the passing of loved ones from Facebook posts months after an incident has occurred.Abdul Karim Barry, 17.Credit: Courtesy of the familyA short, dangerous crossingMorocco offers the shortest passage to Europe of any African country — less than eight miles across the Mediterranean Sea — and the Spanish enclaves of Melilla and Ceuta make it the only country on the African continent to share a land border with the internally borderless EU.It is one of the most trafficked border regions in the world right now, with the number of people attempting to escape violence and poverty across West and Central Africa growing daily. The closing of other primary routes to Europe in Libya, where migrants are now being bought and sold in an emergent slave trade, is pushing more people to Morocco’s borders.Houseine Traoré, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBut the steady reinforcement of the Spain-Morocco land border, which is now secured by three rings of 20-foot high razor-wire fences and under constant surveillance by the Guardia Civil, means even more are attempting treacherous sea crossings.According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the number of migrants reaching Spain by way of the Mediterranean tripled to nearly 22,000 last year, and the number of reported drownings off the Spanish coast doubled. However, the 223 drownings reported in 2017 only account for bodies that were recovered and identified.Hassane Traoré, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyLess than two months into 2018, there have already been 75 victims recovered, including the 21 found floating off the coast of Melilla last month. How many others remain in the water?No namesThe week of the incident, major news organizations from The New York Times to El Mundo covered the latest Mediterranean tragedy, but regardless of which source you follow, you read the same facts.Alpha Moron Diallo, 23.Credit: Courtesy of the familyTwenty-one bodies. All African migrants. All packed into a small wooden fishing boat that capsized off the coast of Morocco’s Spanish enclave.There was no follow-up as the victim count edged upward, ultimately winding up more than double what was originally reported.As I followed the coverage by various sources, I noticed there was never a single name released.Who are all of these people, assigned numbers, not names, in the morgue? Where were they coming from, what had driven them to their final crossing, and what had they expected to find on the other side?Alhassane Barry, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyI needed more than a number. I didn’t want to simply break the news that it was 47 migrants and two smugglers, not 21 people, who were lost at sea. I wanted to report who had been lost. I enlisted the migrants still living in Morocco’s hidden camps to help me collect names, faces and stories. They knew better than anyone the group who left just after nightfall on Feb. 3 to walk 16 miles to the meeting point their smugglers had given them.An anthropologist by training, I started working on issues of migration and international human rights a decade ago and have spent many years living in the hundreds of makeshift camps around primary departure points in Morocco, Algeria and Libya. The first time I gained access to Carrière — one of Morocco’s largest and most tightly controlled camps — was when I was working on another story for PRI in the summer of 2016.Amoudoubailo Diallo, 20.Credit: Courtesy of the familyIt was a complicated process requiring permitting at the governmental level and clearance at the local level — from the smuggling rings that control the space and the brotherhoods of migrants themselves.I spent the following year in the region finishing a documentary film that captures the journeys of three migrants from Guinea, Mali and the DRC to their final attempted crossings. I was back in Carrière as recently as last month. In fact, I had only been back in the US for a week when I received my first phone call alerting me to the capsized boat carrying people I knew well.Bouboucar Bah, 32.Credit: Courtesy of the family'Smart, brave, generous'The photograph of Abdul Karim Barry — a 17-year-old boy from Guinea — was one of the first I saw.Karim had been in Carrière awaiting his chance at crossing for over two years. He left his home at the age of 15 and traveled more than 3,000 miles alone — from Guinea to Morocco. After his father died, he felt responsible for taking care of his younger brothers and sisters when his mother couldn’t find any way to support the family in their rural community. He wanted to give his siblings the chance to go to school like his father had given him.Ben Ali Bah, 24.Credit: Courtesy of the family“Karim was smart and brave and above all, he was generous,” one of his closest friends, Mamadou Bah, tells me over a crackling phone line. “He always struggled for the well-being of the group, even risking the dangers of going into the street to beg for us when we couldn't find enough food to eat. It was Karim who prepared the one daily meal for our brotherhood every night.”I posted a photograph of him and asked his friends in Morocco and Guinea to help me make him more than a number.“Karim studied hard before leaving home,” Thierno Jalloh wrote, “and he used his education to speak up for the other boys who didn't have any. He was young, but he was a natural leader with a big heart. He couldn’t stand for anyone to be treated as less than human because of the color of their skin.”Alpha ""Bambino"" Bah, 14.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAbdoulaye Barry wrote, “He told me he dreamed of becoming a soccer player when he was little. He played on a team in Guinea, and he was really good. But as you grow older, you realize some of your dreams won’t ever be realized. Still, Karim played with me in the forest sometimes. We had a ball we made out of plastic and tape.”Rough conditionsIn the hours before the first bodies were spotted, Karim, along with 46 men, women, and children coming from Guinea, Cote D’Ivoire, Cameroon, Senegal and Mali left their camp in Carrière. Their smugglers, two Moroccan men, were waiting for them on a rocky beach in Arekmane.Mamadou Billo Diallo, 25.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThey carried a small wooden fishing boat that had been rigged with an outboard motor down to the water. A witness who traveled with the migrants but didn’t board the boat that night said the winds were too strong for a safe crossing — 50 mph, according to official reports.So why would smugglers choose to travel, risking their own lives, under such rough conditions?In previous years, they wouldn’t have. But new systems created to protect migrants’ financial investments have made tragedies like this one significantly more likely. In 2016, I knew dozens of migrants who were devastated when they paid 1,500 to 2,500 euros and failed to reach the other side. This left them trapped in Morocco for many more years, struggling to save up enough money to try again.Amoudou Taibou Diallo, 16.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThis past summer, I noticed a niche market had emerged with some smugglers stepping into the business of transferring money from migrant to smuggler — only after they had safely reached Spanish soil. For a 10 percent increase in fee, migrants can now pay these third parties and secure their investments.Those who find themselves back in Morocco after a boat has capsized or a police vessel has re-routed them, as happens more often than not, have the money to try again.For the smugglers who captained the boat on Feb. 4, a postponed departure would have meant approximately 96,000 euros returned. Another factor: The witness explained how smugglers often call for last-minute departures when bad weather is on the horizon, knowing storms make it easier to evade surveillance efforts by the Guardia Civil.Mamadou Aliou ""Barkley"" Diallo, 34.Credit: Courtesy of the familyWith an overcrowded boat and waves reaching three meters high, they capsized less than an hour into their journey. The passengers were thrown into freezing water without enough life jackets — many of them not knowing how to swim. The oldest reported passenger on board was 34, the youngest had just turned 14. There were at least eight women, one of them pregnant.Lone survivorTwo days after the tragedy, the Royal Navy of Morocco reported that, miraculously, one young man from Mali had been found alive. After a series of interrogations, he was accused of taking part in an illegal operation and is currently being held in police custody.The Nadori police told me they are continuing to search for the top-level smugglers thought to have masterminded this operation and many others like it.Oury Diallo, 18.Credit: Courtesy of the familyPhotographs, names and questions have poured in ever since. Along with them, I received final videos that were recorded by young men like Mamadou Diallo, 21, who tells his mother, “I’ve suffered greatly in my journey to Morocco, but it’s all been worthwhile because, soon, I’ll be calling you from Spain.”And Safourata Sow, 28, who tells her three daughters how much she loves them and misses them.Again and again, I listened to the words of Karim, who was one of the last boys I interviewed in person. Sitting by his makeshift tent he tells me, “We've traveled so far, we've been through so much, I finally understand what my brothers meant when they told me, 'I'll make it to Europe or I'll die trying.' After you've endured the horrors of this journey to Morocco, there's only one way home.”Mamadou Saliou Bah, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the familyGiven the lack of access to basic social services and the active fighting in some communities in West Africa, it is not uncommon to hear of boys like Karim traveling thousands of miles north in search of a way to support their families. Hassane and Houseine Traoré — 28-year-old twin brothers from Cote D’Ivoire — had a similar story to tell.“They were the coolest guys,” says an old friend, Stephanie Dokou, who grew up with them in Cote D’Ivoire. “They were the best athletes our village had ever seen, they played music and sang, they did well in school.

The ferry is part of Trasmediterránea’s large fleet and makes a daily trip between Melilla and Almería, on the Spanish mainland, carrying up to 1,250 passengers on each crossing.Some 4,000 miles away, my cell phone started ringing. I spent most of the following week on the phone with families across West Africa who were desperately searching for any information about their loved ones.Tidiane Jalloh ""TJ""  Bah, 17.Credit: Courtesy of the familyMy son, is he alive? My wife, have they found her body yet? When will we know? How will we know? Is anyone looking for them?For tourists seeking a day-trip to Morocco, there are a host of ferry options from Spain — most take 30 minutes and cost 25 euros per passenger. For African migrants, refugees and asylum seekers seeking the chance at a better life in Europe, there are a host of smuggling options running the same routes in reverse. Most take a full day’s journey at sea and cost an average of 2,000 euros per passenger.Tahirou Barry, 22.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBoarding one of Trasmediterránea’s new ferries, you might notice a small sign warning you of seasickness. Boarding one of the small wooden fishing boats that smugglers captain from Morocco’s coast, migrants don’t need a sign warning them that, as one 15-year-old boy tells me, “You’ll make it to Europe or you’ll die trying.”A difficult processAfter being alerted to bodies floating in the open sea, Maritime Rescue sent a ship from Melilla to begin searching for survivors, and the Guardia Civil launched two smaller rescue missions as well. In the hours that followed, the Royal Navy of Morocco ended up recovering the majority of the bodies, which had drifted to their coastline by the time they responded.Mohammed Diallo, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThe officers placed 20 bodies in one massive, blue plastic bag made for tragedies like this and took them to El Hassani Hospital in Nador. The one body recovered by Spanish police was taken to Melilla. At the morgue, I was told recently, 16 of the 20 bodies remain unidentified.“We have a poster hanging in the police station in Nador with pictures of each face, so the families can identify them,"" an official said.But their families aren’t in Morocco, and the friends of these victims live hidden in forest camps that are routinely under attack by Moroccan police, who threaten to beat, imprison or deport anyone found. The lack of official reporting by Spain and Morocco means family members are left with more questions than answers, often learning about the passing of loved ones from Facebook posts months after an incident has occurred.Abdul Karim Barry, 17.Credit: Courtesy of the familyA short, dangerous crossingMorocco offers the shortest passage to Europe of any African country — less than eight miles across the Mediterranean Sea — and the Spanish enclaves of Melilla and Ceuta make it the only country on the African continent to share a land border with the internally borderless EU.It is one of the most trafficked border regions in the world right now, with the number of people attempting to escape violence and poverty across West and Central Africa growing daily. The closing of other primary routes to Europe in Libya, where migrants are now being bought and sold in an emergent slave trade, is pushing more people to Morocco’s borders.Houseine Traoré, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBut the steady reinforcement of the Spain-Morocco land border, which is now secured by three rings of 20-foot high razor-wire fences and under constant surveillance by the Guardia Civil, means even more are attempting treacherous sea crossings.According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the number of migrants reaching Spain by way of the Mediterranean tripled to nearly 22,000 last year, and the number of reported drownings off the Spanish coast doubled. However, the 223 drownings reported in 2017 only account for bodies that were recovered and identified.Hassane Traoré, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyLess than two months into 2018, there have already been 75 victims recovered, including the 21 found floating off the coast of Melilla last month.

They knew better than anyone the group who left just after nightfall on Feb. 3 to walk 16 miles to the meeting point their smugglers had given them.An anthropologist by training, I started working on issues of migration and international human rights a decade ago and have spent many years living in the hundreds of makeshift camps around primary departure points in Morocco, Algeria and Libya.

He left his home at the age of 15 and traveled more than 3,000 miles alone — from Guinea to Morocco. After his father died, he felt responsible for taking care of his younger brothers and sisters when his mother couldn’t find any way to support the family in their rural community. He wanted to give his siblings the chance to go to school like his father had given him.Ben Ali Bah, 24.Credit: Courtesy of the family“Karim was smart and brave and above all, he was generous,” one of his closest friends, Mamadou Bah, tells me over a crackling phone line. “He always struggled for the well-being of the group, even risking the dangers of going into the street to beg for us when we couldn't find enough food to eat. It was Karim who prepared the one daily meal for our brotherhood every night.”I posted a photograph of him and asked his friends in Morocco and Guinea to help me make him more than a number.“Karim studied hard before leaving home,” Thierno Jalloh wrote, “and he used his education to speak up for the other boys who didn't have any. He was young, but he was a natural leader with a big heart. He couldn’t stand for anyone to be treated as less than human because of the color of their skin.”Alpha ""Bambino"" Bah, 14.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAbdoulaye Barry wrote, “He told me he dreamed of becoming a soccer player when he was little. He played on a team in Guinea, and he was really good. But as you grow older, you realize some of your dreams won’t ever be realized. Still, Karim played with me in the forest sometimes. We had a ball we made out of plastic and tape.”Rough conditionsIn the hours before the first bodies were spotted, Karim, along with 46 men, women, and children coming from Guinea, Cote D’Ivoire, Cameroon, Senegal and Mali left their camp in Carrière. Their smugglers, two Moroccan men, were waiting for them on a rocky beach in Arekmane.Mamadou Billo Diallo, 25.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThey carried a small wooden fishing boat that had been rigged with an outboard motor down to the water. A witness who traveled with the migrants but didn’t board the boat that night said the winds were too strong for a safe crossing — 50 mph, according to official reports.So why would smugglers choose to travel, risking their own lives, under such rough conditions?In previous years, they wouldn’t have. But new systems created to protect migrants’ financial investments have made tragedies like this one significantly more likely. In 2016, I knew dozens of migrants who were devastated when they paid 1,500 to 2,500 euros and failed to reach the other side. This left them trapped in Morocco for many more years, struggling to save up enough money to try again.Amoudou Taibou Diallo, 16.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThis past summer, I noticed a niche market had emerged with some smugglers stepping into the business of transferring money from migrant to smuggler — only after they had safely reached Spanish soil. For a 10 percent increase in fee, migrants can now pay these third parties and secure their investments.Those who find themselves back in Morocco after a boat has capsized or a police vessel has re-routed them, as happens more often than not, have the money to try again.For the smugglers who captained the boat on Feb. 4, a postponed departure would have meant approximately 96,000 euros returned. Another factor: The witness explained how smugglers often call for last-minute departures when bad weather is on the horizon, knowing storms make it easier to evade surveillance efforts by the Guardia Civil.Mamadou Aliou ""Barkley"" Diallo, 34.Credit: Courtesy of the familyWith an overcrowded boat and waves reaching three meters high, they capsized less than an hour into their journey. The passengers were thrown into freezing water without enough life jackets — many of them not knowing how to swim. The oldest reported passenger on board was 34, the youngest had just turned 14. There were at least eight women, one of them pregnant.Lone survivorTwo days after the tragedy, the Royal Navy of Morocco reported that, miraculously, one young man from Mali had been found alive. After a series of interrogations, he was accused of taking part in an illegal operation and is currently being held in police custody.The Nadori police told me they are continuing to search for the top-level smugglers thought to have masterminded this operation and many others like it.Oury Diallo, 18.Credit: Courtesy of the familyPhotographs, names and questions have poured in ever since. Along with them, I received final videos that were recorded by young men like Mamadou Diallo, 21, who tells his mother, “I’ve suffered greatly in my journey to Morocco, but it’s all been worthwhile because, soon, I’ll be calling you from Spain.”And Safourata Sow, 28, who tells her three daughters how much she loves them and misses them.Again and again, I listened to the words of Karim, who was one of the last boys I interviewed in person. Sitting by his makeshift tent he tells me, “We've traveled so far, we've been through so much, I finally understand what my brothers meant when they told me, 'I'll make it to Europe or I'll die trying.' After you've endured the horrors of this journey to Morocco, there's only one way home.”Mamadou Saliou Bah, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the familyGiven the lack of access to basic social services and the active fighting in some communities in West Africa, it is not uncommon to hear of boys like Karim traveling thousands of miles north in search of a way to support their families. Hassane and Houseine Traoré — 28-year-old twin brothers from Cote D’Ivoire — had a similar story to tell.“They were the coolest guys,” says an old friend, Stephanie Dokou, who grew up with them in Cote D’Ivoire. “They were the best athletes our village had ever seen, they played music and sang, they did well in school. All the girls loved them. We knew they would go on to do great things.”Jalloh ""JJ"" Thierno Bah, 26.Credit: Courtesy of the family“They were always together,” explains another old friend, Y’souf Bella. ""One never did anything without the other.”Including their final crossing to Europe. Both boarded the boat, neither body has been found. Their mother calls me every day in hopes I will have some other news. Although Hassane and Houseine were adored in their camp in Morocco, it was difficult for me to track down their actual names for this story, because everyone there knew the charismatic young men simply as “the twins.”The Traoré brothers were not the only twins, though. Alhassane Barry, 26, from Guinea was also on board.Mamadou Saliou Bah, 23.Credit: Courtesy of the family""Hassane was the quiet one. His twin was the outgoing one. Hassane always looked up to his brother, but, in a lot of ways, it was him who the rest of us admired,” said one of his closest friends, Mamadousaliou Diallo, who made it from Morocco to Europe last year.“They lost their father when they were young, and they were both devoted to their mother. She worked so hard to be able to send them to university, and they wanted to provide a better life for her. Hassane studied sociology. He was one of the best students in his class, but when he graduated, there was no work for him. In Guinea, it doesn’t matter how smart you are. If you’re not from a wealthy family, you won’t find a good job. He didn’t tell his brother he was leaving, because he didn’t want him to worry. I was the one who called him to tell him about the tragedy. I wanted him to hear it from a friend before he saw Hassane’s photo on Facebook. He couldn’t breathe. I remember him choking back his tears, saying, how am I going to tell our mother?”Ali Keita, 27.Credit: Courtesy of the family The youngest victimsBut not everyone had a family at home waiting for news of their safe crossing. Youssouf Diallo, 16, and her little brother, 14, who was the youngest reported passenger on board, left their home after losing both of their parents. In the camps, one of the little boy’s friends tells me he cried when he realized there was no one left to notify of their death.Youssouf’s friend, Fatima Diallo, also 16, says, “I made a flower necklace and burned it in the fire last night. Youssouf and I used to make them together.”Some others had family waiting for them on the other side. Tahirou Barry, 24, from Guinea was one of them.""Junior,"" 29.Credit: Courtesy of the familyHis friend, Hady Cissé, tells me, “He had a beautiful woman waiting for him in France! She was the love of his life. They’d known each other since they were little and got married right after university. Tahirou saved up all of his money to help her get a student visa to study abroad after their wedding. They hoped to eventually both finish their studies in Europe, so they could return home and find jobs before having a family of their own. But Tahirou couldn’t wait another two years to see her, so her decided to cross through Morocco. He was counting the days until he would see her again. She didn’t know he had left.”Tidjane Bah, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the familyLike the newlyweds, Marlyatou Diallo, 26, was crossing to meet her husband, who made it to Germany last year and had fallen ill.“Marly wasn’t just my sister — she was the smartest, kindest woman I've ever known,” says Fatima, her older sister, who was watching Marly’s son for her until her return.  Her siblings passed the phone around, each sharing with me their memories of “the little one.”“She’ll be missed by all of us,” her brother, Barry, tells me, “But most of all, she’ll be missed by her husband and son, who she loved with all her heart. How can we explain to him how the world took his mother like this?”Marly’s Facebook page is filled with albums documenting every moment of her son’s life — from his first tooth to his most recent birthday — 5 years old last month.Oumou ""Belle"" Bah, 16.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThe last image she posted was perhaps an answer to her brother’s question — it read, “My son — I carried you for nine months in my body and I’ll carry you always in my heart. If there’s ever a day when I’m not beside you, know that my spirit is still there protecting you.”An incomplete listI have about 47 students in my lecture hall on Wednesday afternoons. Most of them are the same age as those smuggled across the rough waters of the Mediterranean at night. I have thought about how much attention would be devoted to remembering each of their lives if a tragedy of this proportion ever happened.Youssouf Diallo, 18.Credit: Courtesy of the familyFor the past two weeks, I have worked tirelessly collecting names and images, and yet I only have 39. There are still family members who don’t know if their loved ones are gone.Twenty-six lives will never be accounted for in official statistics because no effort was made to recover their bodies from the water. Sixteen of the 21 recovered bodies will soon be dumped in mass graves because no effort was made to identify them in the morgue.The states involved have no incentive to accurately report high death rates, and before reports can be corrected by media sources, a dozen others have occurred.Marlyatou ""Marly"" Diallo, 26.Credit: Courtesy of the familyIn the 24 hours following this tragedy, another boat carrying 39 migrants arrived safely at the Chafarinas Islands off the coast of Morocco, 94 migrants were reported dead in a capsized boat off the coat of Libya, and the Guardia Civil intercepted 31 migrants en route to Melilla. Migration across the Mediterranean is growing by the day.I hope people stop and look at the faces of Marly and Tahirou, Karim and Hassane, “the twins” and the siblings who had no parents to mourn them. I hope they see there were 47 individuals who packed what few belongings they had on their backs, handed their savings over to smugglers, and stepped onto a small wooden fishing boat to begin their lives. They were proud and eager, like students at graduation.Aminatou Diallo, 25.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBut no one was there to see all of the work it had taken for them to get to that final crossing — the thousands of miles journeyed across deserts and in the backs of trucks, the years spent sleeping on forest floors, the untold abuses suffered along the way. They stepped onto a boat carrying dreams of supporting their parents and siblings, partners and children.In all of the years I have spent working in migrant camps across North Africa, I have never met a single individual who wasn't there with the dream of helping someone else left behind. I don't think it's possible to endure the suffering they do unless you have that dream motivating you to reach the other side.Binta ""Bobo"" Baldé, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBefore the waves overthrew the boat, before he fought for one last breath, I imagine Karim was thinking of how long it might take him to save up for a real soccer ball and if the ground in Spain would feel anything like the ground at home.I hope people remember their stories the next time they read headlines about overcrowded boats and numbers, not names, of those lost at sea. The headlines never change, as if the same bodies are washing ashore again and again. But how could it be the same twins who brought music to their hidden camp, the same siblings who clung tightly to one another, the same big-hearted boy with dreams of being a soccer player?Those 47 are gone, soon to be replaced with others, proud and eager.Djenabou Bah, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the family Safourata ""Sofia"" Sow, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyKaissa Camara, 20.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAmadou Bah, 22. Credit: Courtesy of the familyAladji Abdoulaye Diallo, 27.Credit: Courtesy of the familyMamadou Aliou ""Barcley"" Bah, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThierno Bah, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAmadou Bailo Diallo, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the familyMamadou Dian Diallo, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAlpha Oumar Diallo, 19.CCredit: Courtesy of the family40 - 47 Name unknown",35.58318659,-2.795275034,Cabo Tres Forcas,Spain,PRI/PrivateSource/BBC/El Diario/Caminando/IOM/Al-M,http://bit.ly/2DuqHob,1,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,4103,Dorien,08-05-2018,New Entry,24/04/2018,Dorien

Some wore life jackets. But there were a lot of life jackets without any bodies inside. At first I saw just one body, then another and another and another. It was terrible. It’s a moment I’ll never forget.”Mamadou Laly ""Le Grand"" Barry, 30.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThis is the memory of the crew member who first alerted Spanish Maritime Rescue to a capsized boat on Feb. 4. He was working on a ferry en route to Melilla, one of two Spanish enclaves still remaining in northern Africa. The ferry is part of Trasmediterránea’s large fleet and makes a daily trip between Melilla and Almería, on the Spanish mainland, carrying up to 1,250 passengers on each crossing.Some 4,000 miles away, my cell phone started ringing. I spent most of the following week on the phone with families across West Africa who were desperately searching for any information about their loved ones.Tidiane Jalloh ""TJ""  Bah, 17.Credit: Courtesy of the familyMy son, is he alive? My wife, have they found her body yet? When will we know? How will we know? Is anyone looking for them?For tourists seeking a day-trip to Morocco, there are a host of ferry options from Spain — most take 30 minutes and cost 25 euros per passenger. For African migrants, refugees and asylum seekers seeking the chance at a better life in Europe, there are a host of smuggling options running the same routes in reverse. Most take a full day’s journey at sea and cost an average of 2,000 euros per passenger.Tahirou Barry, 22.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBoarding one of Trasmediterránea’s new ferries, you might notice a small sign warning you of seasickness. Boarding one of the small wooden fishing boats that smugglers captain from Morocco’s coast, migrants don’t need a sign warning them that, as one 15-year-old boy tells me, “You’ll make it to Europe or you’ll die trying.”A difficult processAfter being alerted to bodies floating in the open sea, Maritime Rescue sent a ship from Melilla to begin searching for survivors, and the Guardia Civil launched two smaller rescue missions as well. In the hours that followed, the Royal Navy of Morocco ended up recovering the majority of the bodies, which had drifted to their coastline by the time they responded.Mohammed Diallo, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThe officers placed 20 bodies in one massive, blue plastic bag made for tragedies like this and took them to El Hassani Hospital in Nador. The one body recovered by Spanish police was taken to Melilla. At the morgue, I was told recently, 16 of the 20 bodies remain unidentified.“We have a poster hanging in the police station in Nador with pictures of each face, so the families can identify them,"" an official said.But their families aren’t in Morocco, and the friends of these victims live hidden in forest camps that are routinely under attack by Moroccan police, who threaten to beat, imprison or deport anyone found. The lack of official reporting by Spain and Morocco means family members are left with more questions than answers, often learning about the passing of loved ones from Facebook posts months after an incident has occurred.Abdul Karim Barry, 17.Credit: Courtesy of the familyA short, dangerous crossingMorocco offers the shortest passage to Europe of any African country — less than eight miles across the Mediterranean Sea — and the Spanish enclaves of Melilla and Ceuta make it the only country on the African continent to share a land border with the internally borderless EU.It is one of the most trafficked border regions in the world right now, with the number of people attempting to escape violence and poverty across West and Central Africa growing daily. The closing of other primary routes to Europe in Libya, where migrants are now being bought and sold in an emergent slave trade, is pushing more people to Morocco’s borders.Houseine Traoré, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBut the steady reinforcement of the Spain-Morocco land border, which is now secured by three rings of 20-foot high razor-wire fences and under constant surveillance by the Guardia Civil, means even more are attempting treacherous sea crossings.According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the number of migrants reaching Spain by way of the Mediterranean tripled to nearly 22,000 last year, and the number of reported drownings off the Spanish coast doubled. However, the 223 drownings reported in 2017 only account for bodies that were recovered and identified.Hassane Traoré, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyLess than two months into 2018, there have already been 75 victims recovered, including the 21 found floating off the coast of Melilla last month.

All African migrants. All packed into a small wooden fishing boat that capsized off the coast of Morocco’s Spanish enclave.There was no follow-up as the victim count edged upward, ultimately winding up more than double what was originally reported.As I followed the coverage by various sources, I noticed there was never a single name released.Who are all of these people, assigned numbers, not names, in the morgue? Where were they coming from, what had driven them to their final crossing, and what had they expected to find on the other side?Alhassane Barry, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyI needed more than a number. I didn’t want to simply break the news that it was 47 migrants and two smugglers, not 21 people, who were lost at sea. I wanted to report who had been lost. I enlisted the migrants still living in Morocco’s hidden camps to help me collect names, faces and stories. They knew better than anyone the group who left just after nightfall on Feb. 3 to walk 16 miles to the meeting point their smugglers had given them.An anthropologist by training, I started working on issues of migration and international human rights a decade ago and have spent many years living in the hundreds of makeshift camps around primary departure points in Morocco, Algeria and Libya. The first time I gained access to Carrière — one of Morocco’s largest and most tightly controlled camps — was when I was working on another story for PRI in the summer of 2016.Amoudoubailo Diallo, 20.Credit: Courtesy of the familyIt was a complicated process requiring permitting at the governmental level and clearance at the local level — from the smuggling rings that control the space and the brotherhoods of migrants themselves.I spent the following year in the region finishing a documentary film that captures the journeys of three migrants from Guinea, Mali and the DRC to their final attempted crossings. I was back in Carrière as recently as last month. In fact, I had only been back in the US for a week when I received my first phone call alerting me to the capsized boat carrying people I knew well.Bouboucar Bah, 32.Credit: Courtesy of the family'Smart, brave, generous'The photograph of Abdul Karim Barry — a 17-year-old boy from Guinea — was one of the first I saw.Karim had been in Carrière awaiting his chance at crossing for over two years. He left his home at the age of 15 and traveled more than 3,000 miles alone — from Guinea to Morocco. After his father died, he felt responsible for taking care of his younger brothers and sisters when his mother couldn’t find any way to support the family in their rural community. He wanted to give his siblings the chance to go to school like his father had given him.Ben Ali Bah, 24.Credit: Courtesy of the family“Karim was smart and brave and above all, he was generous,” one of his closest friends, Mamadou Bah, tells me over a crackling phone line. “He always struggled for the well-being of the group, even risking the dangers of going into the street to beg for us when we couldn't find enough food to eat. It was Karim who prepared the one daily meal for our brotherhood every night.”I posted a photograph of him and asked his friends in Morocco and Guinea to help me make him more than a number.“Karim studied hard before leaving home,” Thierno Jalloh wrote, “and he used his education to speak up for the other boys who didn't have any. He was young, but he was a natural leader with a big heart. He couldn’t stand for anyone to be treated as less than human because of the color of their skin.”Alpha ""Bambino"" Bah, 14.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAbdoulaye Barry wrote, “He told me he dreamed of becoming a soccer player when he was little. He played on a team in Guinea, and he was really good. But as you grow older, you realize some of your dreams won’t ever be realized. Still, Karim played with me in the forest sometimes. We had a ball we made out of plastic and tape.”Rough conditionsIn the hours before the first bodies were spotted, Karim, along with 46 men, women, and children coming from Guinea, Cote D’Ivoire, Cameroon, Senegal and Mali left their camp in Carrière. Their smugglers, two Moroccan men, were waiting for them on a rocky beach in Arekmane.Mamadou Billo Diallo, 25.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThey carried a small wooden fishing boat that had been rigged with an outboard motor down to the water. A witness who traveled with the migrants but didn’t board the boat that night said the winds were too strong for a safe crossing — 50 mph, according to official reports.So why would smugglers choose to travel, risking their own lives, under such rough conditions?In previous years, they wouldn’t have. But new systems created to protect migrants’ financial investments have made tragedies like this one significantly more likely. In 2016, I knew dozens of migrants who were devastated when they paid 1,500 to 2,500 euros and failed to reach the other side. This left them trapped in Morocco for many more years, struggling to save up enough money to try again.Amoudou Taibou Diallo, 16.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThis past summer, I noticed a niche market had emerged with some smugglers stepping into the business of transferring money from migrant to smuggler — only after they had safely reached Spanish soil.

He was working on a ferry en route to Melilla, one of two Spanish enclaves still remaining in northern Africa. The ferry is part of Trasmediterránea’s large fleet and makes a daily trip between Melilla and Almería, on the Spanish mainland, carrying up to 1,250 passengers on each crossing.Some 4,000 miles away, my cell phone started ringing.

My wife, have they found her body yet? When will we know? How will we know? Is anyone looking for them?For tourists seeking a day-trip to Morocco, there are a host of ferry options from Spain — most take 30 minutes and cost 25 euros per passenger. For African migrants, refugees and asylum seekers seeking the chance at a better life in Europe, there are a host of smuggling options running the same routes in reverse. Most take a full day’s journey at sea and cost an average of 2,000 euros per passenger.Tahirou Barry, 22.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBoarding one of Trasmediterránea’s new ferries, you might notice a small sign warning you of seasickness. Boarding one of the small wooden fishing boats that smugglers captain from Morocco’s coast, migrants don’t need a sign warning them that, as one 15-year-old boy tells me, “You’ll make it to Europe or you’ll die trying.”A difficult processAfter being alerted to bodies floating in the open sea, Maritime Rescue sent a ship from Melilla to begin searching for survivors, and the Guardia Civil launched two smaller rescue missions as well. In the hours that followed, the Royal Navy of Morocco ended up recovering the majority of the bodies, which had drifted to their coastline by the time they responded.Mohammed Diallo, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThe officers placed 20 bodies in one massive, blue plastic bag made for tragedies like this and took them to El Hassani Hospital in Nador.

The lack of official reporting by Spain and Morocco means family members are left with more questions than answers, often learning about the passing of loved ones from Facebook posts months after an incident has occurred.Abdul Karim Barry, 17.Credit: Courtesy of the familyA short, dangerous crossingMorocco offers the shortest passage to Europe of any African country — less than eight miles across the Mediterranean Sea — and the Spanish enclaves of Melilla and Ceuta make it the only country on the African continent to share a land border with the internally borderless EU.It is one of the most trafficked border regions in the world right now, with the number of people attempting to escape violence and poverty across West and Central Africa growing daily. The closing of other primary routes to Europe in Libya, where migrants are now being bought and sold in an emergent slave trade, is pushing more people to Morocco’s borders.Houseine Traoré, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBut the steady reinforcement of the Spain-Morocco land border, which is now secured by three rings of 20-foot high razor-wire fences and under constant surveillance by the Guardia Civil, means even more are attempting treacherous sea crossings.According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the number of migrants reaching Spain by way of the Mediterranean tripled to nearly 22,000 last year, and the number of reported drownings off the Spanish coast doubled. However, the 223 drownings reported in 2017 only account for bodies that were recovered and identified.Hassane Traoré, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyLess than two months into 2018, there have already been 75 victims recovered, including the 21 found floating off the coast of Melilla last month.

I didn’t want to simply break the news that it was 47 migrants and two smugglers, not 21 people, who were lost at sea. I wanted to report who had been lost. I enlisted the migrants still living in Morocco’s hidden camps to help me collect names, faces and stories. They knew better than anyone the group who left just after nightfall on Feb. 3 to walk 16 miles to the meeting point their smugglers had given them.An anthropologist by training, I started working on issues of migration and international human rights a decade ago and have spent many years living in the hundreds of makeshift camps around primary departure points in Morocco, Algeria and Libya. The first time I gained access to Carrière — one of Morocco’s largest and most tightly controlled camps — was when I was working on another story for PRI in the summer of 2016.Amoudoubailo Diallo, 20.Credit: Courtesy of the familyIt was a complicated process requiring permitting at the governmental level and clearance at the local level — from the smuggling rings that control the space and the brotherhoods of migrants themselves.I spent the following year in the region finishing a documentary film that captures the journeys of three migrants from Guinea, Mali and the DRC to their final attempted crossings. I was back in Carrière as recently as last month. In fact, I had only been back in the US for a week when I received my first phone call alerting me to the capsized boat carrying people I knew well.Bouboucar Bah, 32.Credit: Courtesy of the family'Smart, brave, generous'The photograph of Abdul Karim Barry — a 17-year-old boy from Guinea — was one of the first I saw.Karim had been in Carrière awaiting his chance at crossing for over two years. He left his home at the age of 15 and traveled more than 3,000 miles alone — from Guinea to Morocco. After his father died, he felt responsible for taking care of his younger brothers and sisters when his mother couldn’t find any way to support the family in their rural community. He wanted to give his siblings the chance to go to school like his father had given him.Ben Ali Bah, 24.Credit: Courtesy of the family“Karim was smart and brave and above all, he was generous,” one of his closest friends, Mamadou Bah, tells me over a crackling phone line. “He always struggled for the well-being of the group, even risking the dangers of going into the street to beg for us when we couldn't find enough food to eat. It was Karim who prepared the one daily meal for our brotherhood every night.”I posted a photograph of him and asked his friends in Morocco and Guinea to help me make him more than a number.“Karim studied hard before leaving home,” Thierno Jalloh wrote, “and he used his education to speak up for the other boys who didn't have any. He was young, but he was a natural leader with a big heart. He couldn’t stand for anyone to be treated as less than human because of the color of their skin.”Alpha ""Bambino"" Bah, 14.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAbdoulaye Barry wrote, “He told me he dreamed of becoming a soccer player when he was little. He played on a team in Guinea, and he was really good. But as you grow older, you realize some of your dreams won’t ever be realized. Still, Karim played with me in the forest sometimes. We had a ball we made out of plastic and tape.”Rough conditionsIn the hours before the first bodies were spotted, Karim, along with 46 men, women, and children coming from Guinea, Cote D’Ivoire, Cameroon, Senegal and Mali left their camp in Carrière. Their smugglers, two Moroccan men, were waiting for them on a rocky beach in Arekmane.Mamadou Billo Diallo, 25.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThey carried a small wooden fishing boat that had been rigged with an outboard motor down to the water. A witness who traveled with the migrants but didn’t board the boat that night said the winds were too strong for a safe crossing — 50 mph, according to official reports.So why would smugglers choose to travel, risking their own lives, under such rough conditions?In previous years, they wouldn’t have. But new systems created to protect migrants’ financial investments have made tragedies like this one significantly more likely. In 2016, I knew dozens of migrants who were devastated when they paid 1,500 to 2,500 euros and failed to reach the other side. This left them trapped in Morocco for many more years, struggling to save up enough money to try again.Amoudou Taibou Diallo, 16.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThis past summer, I noticed a niche market had emerged with some smugglers stepping into the business of transferring money from migrant to smuggler — only after they had safely reached Spanish soil. For a 10 percent increase in fee, migrants can now pay these third parties and secure their investments.Those who find themselves back in Morocco after a boat has capsized or a police vessel has re-routed them, as happens more often than not, have the money to try again.For the smugglers who captained the boat on Feb. 4, a postponed departure would have meant approximately 96,000 euros returned. Another factor: The witness explained how smugglers often call for last-minute departures when bad weather is on the horizon, knowing storms make it easier to evade surveillance efforts by the Guardia Civil.Mamadou Aliou ""Barkley"" Diallo, 34.Credit: Courtesy of the familyWith an overcrowded boat and waves reaching three meters high, they capsized less than an hour into their journey. The passengers were thrown into freezing water without enough life jackets — many of them not knowing how to swim. The oldest reported passenger on board was 34, the youngest had just turned 14. There were at least eight women, one of them pregnant.Lone survivorTwo days after the tragedy, the Royal Navy of Morocco reported that, miraculously, one young man from Mali had been found alive. After a series of interrogations, he was accused of taking part in an illegal operation and is currently being held in police custody.The Nadori police told me they are continuing to search for the top-level smugglers thought to have masterminded this operation and many others like it.Oury Diallo, 18.Credit: Courtesy of the familyPhotographs, names and questions have poured in ever since. Along with them, I received final videos that were recorded by young men like Mamadou Diallo, 21, who tells his mother, “I’ve suffered greatly in my journey to Morocco, but it’s all been worthwhile because, soon, I’ll be calling you from Spain.”And Safourata Sow, 28, who tells her three daughters how much she loves them and misses them.Again and again, I listened to the words of Karim, who was one of the last boys I interviewed in person. Sitting by his makeshift tent he tells me, “We've traveled so far, we've been through so much, I finally understand what my brothers meant when they told me, 'I'll make it to Europe or I'll die trying.' After you've endured the horrors of this journey to Morocco, there's only one way home.”Mamadou Saliou Bah, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the familyGiven the lack of access to basic social services and the active fighting in some communities in West Africa, it is not uncommon to hear of boys like Karim traveling thousands of miles north in search of a way to support their families. Hassane and Houseine Traoré — 28-year-old twin brothers from Cote D’Ivoire — had a similar story to tell.“They were the coolest guys,” says an old friend, Stephanie Dokou, who grew up with them in Cote D’Ivoire. “They were the best athletes our village had ever seen, they played music and sang, they did well in school. All the girls loved them. We knew they would go on to do great things.”Jalloh ""JJ"" Thierno Bah, 26.Credit: Courtesy of the family“They were always together,” explains another old friend, Y’souf Bella. ""One never did anything without the other.”Including their final crossing to Europe. Both boarded the boat, neither body has been found. Their mother calls me every day in hopes I will have some other news. Although Hassane and Houseine were adored in their camp in Morocco, it was difficult for me to track down their actual names for this story, because everyone there knew the charismatic young men simply as “the twins.”The Traoré brothers were not the only twins, though. Alhassane Barry, 26, from Guinea was also on board.Mamadou Saliou Bah, 23.Credit: Courtesy of the family""Hassane was the quiet one. His twin was the outgoing one. Hassane always looked up to his brother, but, in a lot of ways, it was him who the rest of us admired,” said one of his closest friends, Mamadousaliou Diallo, who made it from Morocco to Europe last year.“They lost their father when they were young, and they were both devoted to their mother. She worked so hard to be able to send them to university, and they wanted to provide a better life for her. Hassane studied sociology. He was one of the best students in his class, but when he graduated, there was no work for him. In Guinea, it doesn’t matter how smart you are. If you’re not from a wealthy family, you won’t find a good job. He didn’t tell his brother he was leaving, because he didn’t want him to worry. I was the one who called him to tell him about the tragedy. I wanted him to hear it from a friend before he saw Hassane’s photo on Facebook. He couldn’t breathe. I remember him choking back his tears, saying, how am I going to tell our mother?”Ali Keita, 27.Credit: Courtesy of the family The youngest victimsBut not everyone had a family at home waiting for news of their safe crossing. Youssouf Diallo, 16, and her little brother, 14, who was the youngest reported passenger on board, left their home after losing both of their parents. In the camps, one of the little boy’s friends tells me he cried when he realized there was no one left to notify of their death.Youssouf’s friend, Fatima Diallo, also 16, says, “I made a flower necklace and burned it in the fire last night. Youssouf and I used to make them together.”Some others had family waiting for them on the other side. Tahirou Barry, 24, from Guinea was one of them.""Junior,"" 29.Credit: Courtesy of the familyHis friend, Hady Cissé, tells me, “He had a beautiful woman waiting for him in France! She was the love of his life. They’d known each other since they were little and got married right after university. Tahirou saved up all of his money to help her get a student visa to study abroad after their wedding. They hoped to eventually both finish their studies in Europe, so they could return home and find jobs before having a family of their own. But Tahirou couldn’t wait another two years to see her, so her decided to cross through Morocco. He was counting the days until he would see her again. She didn’t know he had left.”Tidjane Bah, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the familyLike the newlyweds, Marlyatou Diallo, 26, was crossing to meet her husband, who made it to Germany last year and had fallen ill.“Marly wasn’t just my sister — she was the smartest, kindest woman I've ever known,” says Fatima, her older sister, who was watching Marly’s son for her until her return.  Her siblings passed the phone around, each sharing with me their memories of “the little one.”“She’ll be missed by all of us,” her brother, Barry, tells me, “But most of all, she’ll be missed by her husband and son, who she loved with all her heart. How can we explain to him how the world took his mother like this?”Marly’s Facebook page is filled with albums documenting every moment of her son’s life — from his first tooth to his most recent birthday — 5 years old last month.Oumou ""Belle"" Bah, 16.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThe last image she posted was perhaps an answer to her brother’s question — it read, “My son — I carried you for nine months in my body and I’ll carry you always in my heart. If there’s ever a day when I’m not beside you, know that my spirit is still there protecting you.”An incomplete listI have about 47 students in my lecture hall on Wednesday afternoons. Most of them are the same age as those smuggled across the rough waters of the Mediterranean at night. I have thought about how much attention would be devoted to remembering each of their lives if a tragedy of this proportion ever happened.Youssouf Diallo, 18.Credit: Courtesy of the familyFor the past two weeks, I have worked tirelessly collecting names and images, and yet I only have 39. There are still family members who don’t know if their loved ones are gone.Twenty-six lives will never be accounted for in official statistics because no effort was made to recover their bodies from the water. Sixteen of the 21 recovered bodies will soon be dumped in mass graves because no effort was made to identify them in the morgue.The states involved have no incentive to accurately report high death rates, and before reports can be corrected by media sources, a dozen others have occurred.Marlyatou ""Marly"" Diallo, 26.Credit: Courtesy of the familyIn the 24 hours following this tragedy, another boat carrying 39 migrants arrived safely at the Chafarinas Islands off the coast of Morocco, 94 migrants were reported dead in a capsized boat off the coat of Libya, and the Guardia Civil intercepted 31 migrants en route to Melilla. Migration across the Mediterranean is growing by the day.I hope people stop and look at the faces of Marly and Tahirou, Karim and Hassane, “the twins” and the siblings who had no parents to mourn them. I hope they see there were 47 individuals who packed what few belongings they had on their backs, handed their savings over to smugglers, and stepped onto a small wooden fishing boat to begin their lives. They were proud and eager, like students at graduation.Aminatou Diallo, 25.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBut no one was there to see all of the work it had taken for them to get to that final crossing — the thousands of miles journeyed across deserts and in the backs of trucks, the years spent sleeping on forest floors, the untold abuses suffered along the way. They stepped onto a boat carrying dreams of supporting their parents and siblings, partners and children.In all of the years I have spent working in migrant camps across North Africa, I have never met a single individual who wasn't there with the dream of helping someone else left behind. I don't think it's possible to endure the suffering they do unless you have that dream motivating you to reach the other side.Binta ""Bobo"" Baldé, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBefore the waves overthrew the boat, before he fought for one last breath, I imagine Karim was thinking of how long it might take him to save up for a real soccer ball and if the ground in Spain would feel anything like the ground at home.I hope people remember their stories the next time they read headlines about overcrowded boats and numbers, not names, of those lost at sea. The headlines never change, as if the same bodies are washing ashore again and again.

There are still family members who don’t know if their loved ones are gone.Twenty-six lives will never be accounted for in official statistics because no effort was made to recover their bodies from the water. Sixteen of the 21 recovered bodies will soon be dumped in mass graves because no effort was made to identify them in the morgue.The states involved have no incentive to accurately report high death rates, and before reports can be corrected by media sources, a dozen others have occurred.Marlyatou ""Marly"" Diallo, 26.Credit: Courtesy of the familyIn the 24 hours following this tragedy, another boat carrying 39 migrants arrived safely at the Chafarinas Islands off the coast of Morocco, 94 migrants were reported dead in a capsized boat off the coat of Libya, and the Guardia Civil intercepted 31 migrants en route to Melilla. Migration across the Mediterranean is growing by the day.I hope people stop and look at the faces of Marly and Tahirou, Karim and Hassane, “the twins” and the siblings who had no parents to mourn them. I hope they see there were 47 individuals who packed what few belongings they had on their backs, handed their savings over to smugglers, and stepped onto a small wooden fishing boat to begin their lives. They were proud and eager, like students at graduation.Aminatou Diallo, 25.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBut no one was there to see all of the work it had taken for them to get to that final crossing — the thousands of miles journeyed across deserts and in the backs of trucks, the years spent sleeping on forest floors, the untold abuses suffered along the way. They stepped onto a boat carrying dreams of supporting their parents and siblings, partners and children.In all of the years I have spent working in migrant camps across North Africa, I have never met a single individual who wasn't there with the dream of helping someone else left behind. I don't think it's possible to endure the suffering they do unless you have that dream motivating you to reach the other side.Binta ""Bobo"" Baldé, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBefore the waves overthrew the boat, before he fought for one last breath, I imagine Karim was thinking of how long it might take him to save up for a real soccer ball and if the ground in Spain would feel anything like the ground at home.I hope people remember their stories the next time they read headlines about overcrowded boats and numbers, not names, of those lost at sea. The headlines never change, as if the same bodies are washing ashore again and again. But how could it be the same twins who brought music to their hidden camp, the same siblings who clung tightly to one another, the same big-hearted boy with dreams of being a soccer player?Those 47 are gone, soon to be replaced with others, proud and eager.Djenabou Bah, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the family Safourata ""Sofia"" Sow, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyKaissa Camara, 20.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAmadou Bah, 22. Credit: Courtesy of the familyAladji Abdoulaye Diallo, 27.Credit: Courtesy of the familyMamadou Aliou ""Barcley"" Bah, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThierno Bah, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAmadou Bailo Diallo, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the familyMamadou Dian Diallo, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAlpha Oumar Diallo, 19.CCredit: Courtesy of the family40 - 47 Name unknown",35.58318659,-2.795275034,Cabo Tres Forcas,Spain,PRI/PrivateSource/BBC/El Diario/Caminando/IOM/Al-M,http://bit.ly/2DuqHob,1,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,4107,Dorien,08-05-2018,New Entry,24/04/2018,Dorien

Some wore life jackets. But there were a lot of life jackets without any bodies inside. At first I saw just one body, then another and another and another. It was terrible. It’s a moment I’ll never forget.”Mamadou Laly ""Le Grand"" Barry, 30.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThis is the memory of the crew member who first alerted Spanish Maritime Rescue to a capsized boat on Feb. 4. He was working on a ferry en route to Melilla, one of two Spanish enclaves still remaining in northern Africa. The ferry is part of Trasmediterránea’s large fleet and makes a daily trip between Melilla and Almería, on the Spanish mainland, carrying up to 1,250 passengers on each crossing.Some 4,000 miles away, my cell phone started ringing. I spent most of the following week on the phone with families across West Africa who were desperately searching for any information about their loved ones.Tidiane Jalloh ""TJ""  Bah, 17.Credit: Courtesy of the familyMy son, is he alive? My wife, have they found her body yet? When will we know? How will we know? Is anyone looking for them?For tourists seeking a day-trip to Morocco, there are a host of ferry options from Spain — most take 30 minutes and cost 25 euros per passenger. For African migrants, refugees and asylum seekers seeking the chance at a better life in Europe, there are a host of smuggling options running the same routes in reverse. Most take a full day’s journey at sea and cost an average of 2,000 euros per passenger.Tahirou Barry, 22.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBoarding one of Trasmediterránea’s new ferries, you might notice a small sign warning you of seasickness. Boarding one of the small wooden fishing boats that smugglers captain from Morocco’s coast, migrants don’t need a sign warning them that, as one 15-year-old boy tells me, “You’ll make it to Europe or you’ll die trying.”A difficult processAfter being alerted to bodies floating in the open sea, Maritime Rescue sent a ship from Melilla to begin searching for survivors, and the Guardia Civil launched two smaller rescue missions as well. In the hours that followed, the Royal Navy of Morocco ended up recovering the majority of the bodies, which had drifted to their coastline by the time they responded.Mohammed Diallo, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThe officers placed 20 bodies in one massive, blue plastic bag made for tragedies like this and took them to El Hassani Hospital in Nador. The one body recovered by Spanish police was taken to Melilla. At the morgue, I was told recently, 16 of the 20 bodies remain unidentified.“We have a poster hanging in the police station in Nador with pictures of each face, so the families can identify them,"" an official said.But their families aren’t in Morocco, and the friends of these victims live hidden in forest camps that are routinely under attack by Moroccan police, who threaten to beat, imprison or deport anyone found. The lack of official reporting by Spain and Morocco means family members are left with more questions than answers, often learning about the passing of loved ones from Facebook posts months after an incident has occurred.Abdul Karim Barry, 17.Credit: Courtesy of the familyA short, dangerous crossingMorocco offers the shortest passage to Europe of any African country — less than eight miles across the Mediterranean Sea — and the Spanish enclaves of Melilla and Ceuta make it the only country on the African continent to share a land border with the internally borderless EU.It is one of the most trafficked border regions in the world right now, with the number of people attempting to escape violence and poverty across West and Central Africa growing daily. The closing of other primary routes to Europe in Libya, where migrants are now being bought and sold in an emergent slave trade, is pushing more people to Morocco’s borders.Houseine Traoré, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBut the steady reinforcement of the Spain-Morocco land border, which is now secured by three rings of 20-foot high razor-wire fences and under constant surveillance by the Guardia Civil, means even more are attempting treacherous sea crossings.According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the number of migrants reaching Spain by way of the Mediterranean tripled to nearly 22,000 last year, and the number of reported drownings off the Spanish coast doubled. However, the 223 drownings reported in 2017 only account for bodies that were recovered and identified.Hassane Traoré, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyLess than two months into 2018, there have already been 75 victims recovered, including the 21 found floating off the coast of Melilla last month.

Where were they coming from, what had driven them to their final crossing, and what had they expected to find on the other side?Alhassane Barry, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyI needed more than a number. I didn’t want to simply break the news that it was 47 migrants and two smugglers, not 21 people, who were lost at sea. I wanted to report who had been lost. I enlisted the migrants still living in Morocco’s hidden camps to help me collect names, faces and stories. They knew better than anyone the group who left just after nightfall on Feb. 3 to walk 16 miles to the meeting point their smugglers had given them.An anthropologist by training, I started working on issues of migration and international human rights a decade ago and have spent many years living in the hundreds of makeshift camps around primary departure points in Morocco, Algeria and Libya.

Some wore life jackets. But there were a lot of life jackets without any bodies inside. At first I saw just one body, then another and another and another. It was terrible. It’s a moment I’ll never forget.”Mamadou Laly ""Le Grand"" Barry, 30.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThis is the memory of the crew member who first alerted Spanish Maritime Rescue to a capsized boat on Feb. 4. He was working on a ferry en route to Melilla, one of two Spanish enclaves still remaining in northern Africa. The ferry is part of Trasmediterránea’s large fleet and makes a daily trip between Melilla and Almería, on the Spanish mainland, carrying up to 1,250 passengers on each crossing.Some 4,000 miles away, my cell phone started ringing. I spent most of the following week on the phone with families across West Africa who were desperately searching for any information about their loved ones.Tidiane Jalloh ""TJ""  Bah, 17.Credit: Courtesy of the familyMy son, is he alive? My wife, have they found her body yet? When will we know? How will we know? Is anyone looking for them?For tourists seeking a day-trip to Morocco, there are a host of ferry options from Spain — most take 30 minutes and cost 25 euros per passenger. For African migrants, refugees and asylum seekers seeking the chance at a better life in Europe, there are a host of smuggling options running the same routes in reverse. Most take a full day’s journey at sea and cost an average of 2,000 euros per passenger.Tahirou Barry, 22.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBoarding one of Trasmediterránea’s new ferries, you might notice a small sign warning you of seasickness. Boarding one of the small wooden fishing boats that smugglers captain from Morocco’s coast, migrants don’t need a sign warning them that, as one 15-year-old boy tells me, “You’ll make it to Europe or you’ll die trying.”A difficult processAfter being alerted to bodies floating in the open sea, Maritime Rescue sent a ship from Melilla to begin searching for survivors, and the Guardia Civil launched two smaller rescue missions as well. In the hours that followed, the Royal Navy of Morocco ended up recovering the majority of the bodies, which had drifted to their coastline by the time they responded.Mohammed Diallo, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThe officers placed 20 bodies in one massive, blue plastic bag made for tragedies like this and took them to El Hassani Hospital in Nador. The one body recovered by Spanish police was taken to Melilla. At the morgue, I was told recently, 16 of the 20 bodies remain unidentified.“We have a poster hanging in the police station in Nador with pictures of each face, so the families can identify them,"" an official said.But their families aren’t in Morocco, and the friends of these victims live hidden in forest camps that are routinely under attack by Moroccan police, who threaten to beat, imprison or deport anyone found. The lack of official reporting by Spain and Morocco means family members are left with more questions than answers, often learning about the passing of loved ones from Facebook posts months after an incident has occurred.Abdul Karim Barry, 17.Credit: Courtesy of the familyA short, dangerous crossingMorocco offers the shortest passage to Europe of any African country — less than eight miles across the Mediterranean Sea — and the Spanish enclaves of Melilla and Ceuta make it the only country on the African continent to share a land border with the internally borderless EU.It is one of the most trafficked border regions in the world right now, with the number of people attempting to escape violence and poverty across West and Central Africa growing daily. The closing of other primary routes to Europe in Libya, where migrants are now being bought and sold in an emergent slave trade, is pushing more people to Morocco’s borders.Houseine Traoré, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBut the steady reinforcement of the Spain-Morocco land border, which is now secured by three rings of 20-foot high razor-wire fences and under constant surveillance by the Guardia Civil, means even more are attempting treacherous sea crossings.According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the number of migrants reaching Spain by way of the Mediterranean tripled to nearly 22,000 last year, and the number of reported drownings off the Spanish coast doubled. However, the 223 drownings reported in 2017 only account for bodies that were recovered and identified.Hassane Traoré, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyLess than two months into 2018, there have already been 75 victims recovered, including the 21 found floating off the coast of Melilla last month.

All African migrants. All packed into a small wooden fishing boat that capsized off the coast of Morocco’s Spanish enclave.There was no follow-up as the victim count edged upward, ultimately winding up more than double what was originally reported.As I followed the coverage by various sources, I noticed there was never a single name released.Who are all of these people, assigned numbers, not names, in the morgue? Where were they coming from, what had driven them to their final crossing, and what had they expected to find on the other side?Alhassane Barry, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyI needed more than a number. I didn’t want to simply break the news that it was 47 migrants and two smugglers, not 21 people, who were lost at sea. I wanted to report who had been lost. I enlisted the migrants still living in Morocco’s hidden camps to help me collect names, faces and stories. They knew better than anyone the group who left just after nightfall on Feb. 3 to walk 16 miles to the meeting point their smugglers had given them.An anthropologist by training, I started working on issues of migration and international human rights a decade ago and have spent many years living in the hundreds of makeshift camps around primary departure points in Morocco, Algeria and Libya. The first time I gained access to Carrière — one of Morocco’s largest and most tightly controlled camps — was when I was working on another story for PRI in the summer of 2016.Amoudoubailo Diallo, 20.Credit: Courtesy of the familyIt was a complicated process requiring permitting at the governmental level and clearance at the local level — from the smuggling rings that control the space and the brotherhoods of migrants themselves.I spent the following year in the region finishing a documentary film that captures the journeys of three migrants from Guinea, Mali and the DRC to their final attempted crossings. I was back in Carrière as recently as last month. In fact, I had only been back in the US for a week when I received my first phone call alerting me to the capsized boat carrying people I knew well.Bouboucar Bah, 32.Credit: Courtesy of the family'Smart, brave, generous'The photograph of Abdul Karim Barry — a 17-year-old boy from Guinea — was one of the first I saw.Karim had been in Carrière awaiting his chance at crossing for over two years. He left his home at the age of 15 and traveled more than 3,000 miles alone — from Guinea to Morocco. After his father died, he felt responsible for taking care of his younger brothers and sisters when his mother couldn’t find any way to support the family in their rural community. He wanted to give his siblings the chance to go to school like his father had given him.Ben Ali Bah, 24.Credit: Courtesy of the family“Karim was smart and brave and above all, he was generous,” one of his closest friends, Mamadou Bah, tells me over a crackling phone line. “He always struggled for the well-being of the group, even risking the dangers of going into the street to beg for us when we couldn't find enough food to eat. It was Karim who prepared the one daily meal for our brotherhood every night.”I posted a photograph of him and asked his friends in Morocco and Guinea to help me make him more than a number.“Karim studied hard before leaving home,” Thierno Jalloh wrote, “and he used his education to speak up for the other boys who didn't have any. He was young, but he was a natural leader with a big heart. He couldn’t stand for anyone to be treated as less than human because of the color of their skin.”Alpha ""Bambino"" Bah, 14.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAbdoulaye Barry wrote, “He told me he dreamed of becoming a soccer player when he was little. He played on a team in Guinea, and he was really good. But as you grow older, you realize some of your dreams won’t ever be realized. Still, Karim played with me in the forest sometimes. We had a ball we made out of plastic and tape.”Rough conditionsIn the hours before the first bodies were spotted, Karim, along with 46 men, women, and children coming from Guinea, Cote D’Ivoire, Cameroon, Senegal and Mali left their camp in Carrière. Their smugglers, two Moroccan men, were waiting for them on a rocky beach in Arekmane.Mamadou Billo Diallo, 25.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThey carried a small wooden fishing boat that had been rigged with an outboard motor down to the water. A witness who traveled with the migrants but didn’t board the boat that night said the winds were too strong for a safe crossing — 50 mph, according to official reports.So why would smugglers choose to travel, risking their own lives, under such rough conditions?In previous years, they wouldn’t have. But new systems created to protect migrants’ financial investments have made tragedies like this one significantly more likely. In 2016, I knew dozens of migrants who were devastated when they paid 1,500 to 2,500 euros and failed to reach the other side. This left them trapped in Morocco for many more years, struggling to save up enough money to try again.Amoudou Taibou Diallo, 16.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThis past summer, I noticed a niche market had emerged with some smugglers stepping into the business of transferring money from migrant to smuggler — only after they had safely reached Spanish soil. For a 10 percent increase in fee, migrants can now pay these third parties and secure their investments.Those who find themselves back in Morocco after a boat has capsized or a police vessel has re-routed them, as happens more often than not, have the money to try again.For the smugglers who captained the boat on Feb. 4, a postponed departure would have meant approximately 96,000 euros returned. Another factor: The witness explained how smugglers often call for last-minute departures when bad weather is on the horizon, knowing storms make it easier to evade surveillance efforts by the Guardia Civil.Mamadou Aliou ""Barkley"" Diallo, 34.Credit: Courtesy of the familyWith an overcrowded boat and waves reaching three meters high, they capsized less than an hour into their journey. The passengers were thrown into freezing water without enough life jackets — many of them not knowing how to swim. The oldest reported passenger on board was 34, the youngest had just turned 14. There were at least eight women, one of them pregnant.Lone survivorTwo days after the tragedy, the Royal Navy of Morocco reported that, miraculously, one young man from Mali had been found alive. After a series of interrogations, he was accused of taking part in an illegal operation and is currently being held in police custody.The Nadori police told me they are continuing to search for the top-level smugglers thought to have masterminded this operation and many others like it.Oury Diallo, 18.Credit: Courtesy of the familyPhotographs, names and questions have poured in ever since. Along with them, I received final videos that were recorded by young men like Mamadou Diallo, 21, who tells his mother, “I’ve suffered greatly in my journey to Morocco, but it’s all been worthwhile because, soon, I’ll be calling you from Spain.”And Safourata Sow, 28, who tells her three daughters how much she loves them and misses them.Again and again, I listened to the words of Karim, who was one of the last boys I interviewed in person. Sitting by his makeshift tent he tells me, “We've traveled so far, we've been through so much, I finally understand what my brothers meant when they told me, 'I'll make it to Europe or I'll die trying.' After you've endured the horrors of this journey to Morocco, there's only one way home.”Mamadou Saliou Bah, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the familyGiven the lack of access to basic social services and the active fighting in some communities in West Africa, it is not uncommon to hear of boys like Karim traveling thousands of miles north in search of a way to support their families. Hassane and Houseine Traoré — 28-year-old twin brothers from Cote D’Ivoire — had a similar story to tell.“They were the coolest guys,” says an old friend, Stephanie Dokou, who grew up with them in Cote D’Ivoire. “They were the best athletes our village had ever seen, they played music and sang, they did well in school. All the girls loved them. We knew they would go on to do great things.”Jalloh ""JJ"" Thierno Bah, 26.Credit: Courtesy of the family“They were always together,” explains another old friend, Y’souf Bella. ""One never did anything without the other.”Including their final crossing to Europe. Both boarded the boat, neither body has been found. Their mother calls me every day in hopes I will have some other news. Although Hassane and Houseine were adored in their camp in Morocco, it was difficult for me to track down their actual names for this story, because everyone there knew the charismatic young men simply as “the twins.”The Traoré brothers were not the only twins, though. Alhassane Barry, 26, from Guinea was also on board.Mamadou Saliou Bah, 23.Credit: Courtesy of the family""Hassane was the quiet one. His twin was the outgoing one. Hassane always looked up to his brother, but, in a lot of ways, it was him who the rest of us admired,” said one of his closest friends, Mamadousaliou Diallo, who made it from Morocco to Europe last year.“They lost their father when they were young, and they were both devoted to their mother. She worked so hard to be able to send them to university, and they wanted to provide a better life for her. Hassane studied sociology. He was one of the best students in his class, but when he graduated, there was no work for him. In Guinea, it doesn’t matter how smart you are. If you’re not from a wealthy family, you won’t find a good job. He didn’t tell his brother he was leaving, because he didn’t want him to worry. I was the one who called him to tell him about the tragedy. I wanted him to hear it from a friend before he saw Hassane’s photo on Facebook. He couldn’t breathe. I remember him choking back his tears, saying, how am I going to tell our mother?”Ali Keita, 27.Credit: Courtesy of the family The youngest victimsBut not everyone had a family at home waiting for news of their safe crossing. Youssouf Diallo, 16, and her little brother, 14, who was the youngest reported passenger on board, left their home after losing both of their parents. In the camps, one of the little boy’s friends tells me he cried when he realized there was no one left to notify of their death.Youssouf’s friend, Fatima Diallo, also 16, says, “I made a flower necklace and burned it in the fire last night. Youssouf and I used to make them together.”Some others had family waiting for them on the other side. Tahirou Barry, 24, from Guinea was one of them.""Junior,"" 29.Credit: Courtesy of the familyHis friend, Hady Cissé, tells me, “He had a beautiful woman waiting for him in France! She was the love of his life. They’d known each other since they were little and got married right after university. Tahirou saved up all of his money to help her get a student visa to study abroad after their wedding. They hoped to eventually both finish their studies in Europe, so they could return home and find jobs before having a family of their own. But Tahirou couldn’t wait another two years to see her, so her decided to cross through Morocco. He was counting the days until he would see her again. She didn’t know he had left.”Tidjane Bah, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the familyLike the newlyweds, Marlyatou Diallo, 26, was crossing to meet her husband, who made it to Germany last year and had fallen ill.“Marly wasn’t just my sister — she was the smartest, kindest woman I've ever known,” says Fatima, her older sister, who was watching Marly’s son for her until her return.  Her siblings passed the phone around, each sharing with me their memories of “the little one.”“She’ll be missed by all of us,” her brother, Barry, tells me, “But most of all, she’ll be missed by her husband and son, who she loved with all her heart. How can we explain to him how the world took his mother like this?”Marly’s Facebook page is filled with albums documenting every moment of her son’s life — from his first tooth to his most recent birthday — 5 years old last month.Oumou ""Belle"" Bah, 16.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThe last image she posted was perhaps an answer to her brother’s question — it read, “My son — I carried you for nine months in my body and I’ll carry you always in my heart. If there’s ever a day when I’m not beside you, know that my spirit is still there protecting you.”An incomplete listI have about 47 students in my lecture hall on Wednesday afternoons.

Tahirou saved up all of his money to help her get a student visa to study abroad after their wedding. They hoped to eventually both finish their studies in Europe, so they could return home and find jobs before having a family of their own. But Tahirou couldn’t wait another two years to see her, so her decided to cross through Morocco. He was counting the days until he would see her again. She didn’t know he had left.”Tidjane Bah, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the familyLike the newlyweds, Marlyatou Diallo, 26, was crossing to meet her husband, who made it to Germany last year and had fallen ill.“Marly wasn’t just my sister — she was the smartest, kindest woman I've ever known,” says Fatima, her older sister, who was watching Marly’s son for her until her return.  Her siblings passed the phone around, each sharing with me their memories of “the little one.”“She’ll be missed by all of us,” her brother, Barry, tells me, “But most of all, she’ll be missed by her husband and son, who she loved with all her heart. How can we explain to him how the world took his mother like this?”Marly’s Facebook page is filled with albums documenting every moment of her son’s life — from his first tooth to his most recent birthday — 5 years old last month.Oumou ""Belle"" Bah, 16.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThe last image she posted was perhaps an answer to her brother’s question — it read, “My son — I carried you for nine months in my body and I’ll carry you always in my heart. If there’s ever a day when I’m not beside you, know that my spirit is still there protecting you.”An incomplete listI have about 47 students in my lecture hall on Wednesday afternoons. Most of them are the same age as those smuggled across the rough waters of the Mediterranean at night. I have thought about how much attention would be devoted to remembering each of their lives if a tragedy of this proportion ever happened.Youssouf Diallo, 18.Credit: Courtesy of the familyFor the past two weeks, I have worked tirelessly collecting names and images, and yet I only have 39. There are still family members who don’t know if their loved ones are gone.Twenty-six lives will never be accounted for in official statistics because no effort was made to recover their bodies from the water. Sixteen of the 21 recovered bodies will soon be dumped in mass graves because no effort was made to identify them in the morgue.The states involved have no incentive to accurately report high death rates, and before reports can be corrected by media sources, a dozen others have occurred.Marlyatou ""Marly"" Diallo, 26.Credit: Courtesy of the familyIn the 24 hours following this tragedy, another boat carrying 39 migrants arrived safely at the Chafarinas Islands off the coast of Morocco, 94 migrants were reported dead in a capsized boat off the coat of Libya, and the Guardia Civil intercepted 31 migrants en route to Melilla. Migration across the Mediterranean is growing by the day.I hope people stop and look at the faces of Marly and Tahirou, Karim and Hassane, “the twins” and the siblings who had no parents to mourn them. I hope they see there were 47 individuals who packed what few belongings they had on their backs, handed their savings over to smugglers, and stepped onto a small wooden fishing boat to begin their lives. They were proud and eager, like students at graduation.Aminatou Diallo, 25.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBut no one was there to see all of the work it had taken for them to get to that final crossing — the thousands of miles journeyed across deserts and in the backs of trucks, the years spent sleeping on forest floors, the untold abuses suffered along the way. They stepped onto a boat carrying dreams of supporting their parents and siblings, partners and children.In all of the years I have spent working in migrant camps across North Africa, I have never met a single individual who wasn't there with the dream of helping someone else left behind. I don't think it's possible to endure the suffering they do unless you have that dream motivating you to reach the other side.Binta ""Bobo"" Baldé, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBefore the waves overthrew the boat, before he fought for one last breath, I imagine Karim was thinking of how long it might take him to save up for a real soccer ball and if the ground in Spain would feel anything like the ground at home.I hope people remember their stories the next time they read headlines about overcrowded boats and numbers, not names, of those lost at sea. The headlines never change, as if the same bodies are washing ashore again and again. But how could it be the same twins who brought music to their hidden camp, the same siblings who clung tightly to one another, the same big-hearted boy with dreams of being a soccer player?Those 47 are gone, soon to be replaced with others, proud and eager.Djenabou Bah, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the family Safourata ""Sofia"" Sow, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyKaissa Camara, 20.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAmadou Bah, 22. Credit: Courtesy of the familyAladji Abdoulaye Diallo, 27.Credit: Courtesy of the familyMamadou Aliou ""Barcley"" Bah, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThierno Bah, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAmadou Bailo Diallo, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the familyMamadou Dian Diallo, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAlpha Oumar Diallo, 19.CCredit: Courtesy of the family40 - 47 Name unknown",35.58318659,-2.795275034,Cabo Tres Forcas,Spain,PRI/PrivateSource/BBC/El Diario/Caminando/IOM/Al-M,http://bit.ly/2DuqHob,1,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,4110,Dorien,08-05-2018,New Entry,24/04/2018,Dorien

He was working on a ferry en route to Melilla, one of two Spanish enclaves still remaining in northern Africa. The ferry is part of Trasmediterránea’s large fleet and makes a daily trip between Melilla and Almería, on the Spanish mainland, carrying up to 1,250 passengers on each crossing.Some 4,000 miles away, my cell phone started ringing.

My wife, have they found her body yet? When will we know? How will we know? Is anyone looking for them?For tourists seeking a day-trip to Morocco, there are a host of ferry options from Spain — most take 30 minutes and cost 25 euros per passenger. For African migrants, refugees and asylum seekers seeking the chance at a better life in Europe, there are a host of smuggling options running the same routes in reverse. Most take a full day’s journey at sea and cost an average of 2,000 euros per passenger.Tahirou Barry, 22.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBoarding one of Trasmediterránea’s new ferries, you might notice a small sign warning you of seasickness. Boarding one of the small wooden fishing boats that smugglers captain from Morocco’s coast, migrants don’t need a sign warning them that, as one 15-year-old boy tells me, “You’ll make it to Europe or you’ll die trying.”A difficult processAfter being alerted to bodies floating in the open sea, Maritime Rescue sent a ship from Melilla to begin searching for survivors, and the Guardia Civil launched two smaller rescue missions as well. In the hours that followed, the Royal Navy of Morocco ended up recovering the majority of the bodies, which had drifted to their coastline by the time they responded.Mohammed Diallo, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThe officers placed 20 bodies in one massive, blue plastic bag made for tragedies like this and took them to El Hassani Hospital in Nador. The one body recovered by Spanish police was taken to Melilla. At the morgue, I was told recently, 16 of the 20 bodies remain unidentified.“We have a poster hanging in the police station in Nador with pictures of each face, so the families can identify them,"" an official said.But their families aren’t in Morocco, and the friends of these victims live hidden in forest camps that are routinely under attack by Moroccan police, who threaten to beat, imprison or deport anyone found. The lack of official reporting by Spain and Morocco means family members are left with more questions than answers, often learning about the passing of loved ones from Facebook posts months after an incident has occurred.Abdul Karim Barry, 17.Credit: Courtesy of the familyA short, dangerous crossingMorocco offers the shortest passage to Europe of any African country — less than eight miles across the Mediterranean Sea — and the Spanish enclaves of Melilla and Ceuta make it the only country on the African continent to share a land border with the internally borderless EU.It is one of the most trafficked border regions in the world right now, with the number of people attempting to escape violence and poverty across West and Central Africa growing daily. The closing of other primary routes to Europe in Libya, where migrants are now being bought and sold in an emergent slave trade, is pushing more people to Morocco’s borders.Houseine Traoré, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBut the steady reinforcement of the Spain-Morocco land border, which is now secured by three rings of 20-foot high razor-wire fences and under constant surveillance by the Guardia Civil, means even more are attempting treacherous sea crossings.According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the number of migrants reaching Spain by way of the Mediterranean tripled to nearly 22,000 last year, and the number of reported drownings off the Spanish coast doubled. However, the 223 drownings reported in 2017 only account for bodies that were recovered and identified.Hassane Traoré, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyLess than two months into 2018, there have already been 75 victims recovered, including the 21 found floating off the coast of Melilla last month.

Some wore life jackets. But there were a lot of life jackets without any bodies inside. At first I saw just one body, then another and another and another. It was terrible. It’s a moment I’ll never forget.”Mamadou Laly ""Le Grand"" Barry, 30.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThis is the memory of the crew member who first alerted Spanish Maritime Rescue to a capsized boat on Feb. 4. He was working on a ferry en route to Melilla, one of two Spanish enclaves still remaining in northern Africa. The ferry is part of Trasmediterránea’s large fleet and makes a daily trip between Melilla and Almería, on the Spanish mainland, carrying up to 1,250 passengers on each crossing.Some 4,000 miles away, my cell phone started ringing. I spent most of the following week on the phone with families across West Africa who were desperately searching for any information about their loved ones.Tidiane Jalloh ""TJ""  Bah, 17.Credit: Courtesy of the familyMy son, is he alive? My wife, have they found her body yet? When will we know? How will we know? Is anyone looking for them?For tourists seeking a day-trip to Morocco, there are a host of ferry options from Spain — most take 30 minutes and cost 25 euros per passenger. For African migrants, refugees and asylum seekers seeking the chance at a better life in Europe, there are a host of smuggling options running the same routes in reverse. Most take a full day’s journey at sea and cost an average of 2,000 euros per passenger.Tahirou Barry, 22.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBoarding one of Trasmediterránea’s new ferries, you might notice a small sign warning you of seasickness. Boarding one of the small wooden fishing boats that smugglers captain from Morocco’s coast, migrants don’t need a sign warning them that, as one 15-year-old boy tells me, “You’ll make it to Europe or you’ll die trying.”A difficult processAfter being alerted to bodies floating in the open sea, Maritime Rescue sent a ship from Melilla to begin searching for survivors, and the Guardia Civil launched two smaller rescue missions as well. In the hours that followed, the Royal Navy of Morocco ended up recovering the majority of the bodies, which had drifted to their coastline by the time they responded.Mohammed Diallo, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThe officers placed 20 bodies in one massive, blue plastic bag made for tragedies like this and took them to El Hassani Hospital in Nador. The one body recovered by Spanish police was taken to Melilla. At the morgue, I was told recently, 16 of the 20 bodies remain unidentified.“We have a poster hanging in the police station in Nador with pictures of each face, so the families can identify them,"" an official said.But their families aren’t in Morocco, and the friends of these victims live hidden in forest camps that are routinely under attack by Moroccan police, who threaten to beat, imprison or deport anyone found. The lack of official reporting by Spain and Morocco means family members are left with more questions than answers, often learning about the passing of loved ones from Facebook posts months after an incident has occurred.Abdul Karim Barry, 17.Credit: Courtesy of the familyA short, dangerous crossingMorocco offers the shortest passage to Europe of any African country — less than eight miles across the Mediterranean Sea — and the Spanish enclaves of Melilla and Ceuta make it the only country on the African continent to share a land border with the internally borderless EU.It is one of the most trafficked border regions in the world right now, with the number of people attempting to escape violence and poverty across West and Central Africa growing daily. The closing of other primary routes to Europe in Libya, where migrants are now being bought and sold in an emergent slave trade, is pushing more people to Morocco’s borders.Houseine Traoré, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBut the steady reinforcement of the Spain-Morocco land border, which is now secured by three rings of 20-foot high razor-wire fences and under constant surveillance by the Guardia Civil, means even more are attempting treacherous sea crossings.According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the number of migrants reaching Spain by way of the Mediterranean tripled to nearly 22,000 last year, and the number of reported drownings off the Spanish coast doubled. However, the 223 drownings reported in 2017 only account for bodies that were recovered and identified.Hassane Traoré, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyLess than two months into 2018, there have already been 75 victims recovered, including the 21 found floating off the coast of Melilla last month. How many others remain in the water?No namesThe week of the incident, major news organizations from The New York Times to El Mundo covered the latest Mediterranean tragedy, but regardless of which source you follow, you read the same facts.Alpha Moron Diallo, 23.Credit: Courtesy of the familyTwenty-one bodies. All African migrants. All packed into a small wooden fishing boat that capsized off the coast of Morocco’s Spanish enclave.There was no follow-up as the victim count edged upward, ultimately winding up more than double what was originally reported.As I followed the coverage by various sources, I noticed there was never a single name released.Who are all of these people, assigned numbers, not names, in the morgue? Where were they coming from, what had driven them to their final crossing, and what had they expected to find on the other side?Alhassane Barry, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyI needed more than a number. I didn’t want to simply break the news that it was 47 migrants and two smugglers, not 21 people, who were lost at sea. I wanted to report who had been lost. I enlisted the migrants still living in Morocco’s hidden camps to help me collect names, faces and stories. They knew better than anyone the group who left just after nightfall on Feb. 3 to walk 16 miles to the meeting point their smugglers had given them.An anthropologist by training, I started working on issues of migration and international human rights a decade ago and have spent many years living in the hundreds of makeshift camps around primary departure points in Morocco, Algeria and Libya. The first time I gained access to Carrière — one of Morocco’s largest and most tightly controlled camps — was when I was working on another story for PRI in the summer of 2016.Amoudoubailo Diallo, 20.Credit: Courtesy of the familyIt was a complicated process requiring permitting at the governmental level and clearance at the local level — from the smuggling rings that control the space and the brotherhoods of migrants themselves.I spent the following year in the region finishing a documentary film that captures the journeys of three migrants from Guinea, Mali and the DRC to their final attempted crossings. I was back in Carrière as recently as last month. In fact, I had only been back in the US for a week when I received my first phone call alerting me to the capsized boat carrying people I knew well.Bouboucar Bah, 32.Credit: Courtesy of the family'Smart, brave, generous'The photograph of Abdul Karim Barry — a 17-year-old boy from Guinea — was one of the first I saw.Karim had been in Carrière awaiting his chance at crossing for over two years. He left his home at the age of 15 and traveled more than 3,000 miles alone — from Guinea to Morocco. After his father died, he felt responsible for taking care of his younger brothers and sisters when his mother couldn’t find any way to support the family in their rural community. He wanted to give his siblings the chance to go to school like his father had given him.Ben Ali Bah, 24.Credit: Courtesy of the family“Karim was smart and brave and above all, he was generous,” one of his closest friends, Mamadou Bah, tells me over a crackling phone line. “He always struggled for the well-being of the group, even risking the dangers of going into the street to beg for us when we couldn't find enough food to eat. It was Karim who prepared the one daily meal for our brotherhood every night.”I posted a photograph of him and asked his friends in Morocco and Guinea to help me make him more than a number.“Karim studied hard before leaving home,” Thierno Jalloh wrote, “and he used his education to speak up for the other boys who didn't have any. He was young, but he was a natural leader with a big heart. He couldn’t stand for anyone to be treated as less than human because of the color of their skin.”Alpha ""Bambino"" Bah, 14.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAbdoulaye Barry wrote, “He told me he dreamed of becoming a soccer player when he was little. He played on a team in Guinea, and he was really good. But as you grow older, you realize some of your dreams won’t ever be realized. Still, Karim played with me in the forest sometimes. We had a ball we made out of plastic and tape.”Rough conditionsIn the hours before the first bodies were spotted, Karim, along with 46 men, women, and children coming from Guinea, Cote D’Ivoire, Cameroon, Senegal and Mali left their camp in Carrière. Their smugglers, two Moroccan men, were waiting for them on a rocky beach in Arekmane.Mamadou Billo Diallo, 25.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThey carried a small wooden fishing boat that had been rigged with an outboard motor down to the water. A witness who traveled with the migrants but didn’t board the boat that night said the winds were too strong for a safe crossing — 50 mph, according to official reports.So why would smugglers choose to travel, risking their own lives, under such rough conditions?In previous years, they wouldn’t have. But new systems created to protect migrants’ financial investments have made tragedies like this one significantly more likely. In 2016, I knew dozens of migrants who were devastated when they paid 1,500 to 2,500 euros and failed to reach the other side. This left them trapped in Morocco for many more years, struggling to save up enough money to try again.Amoudou Taibou Diallo, 16.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThis past summer, I noticed a niche market had emerged with some smugglers stepping into the business of transferring money from migrant to smuggler — only after they had safely reached Spanish soil. For a 10 percent increase in fee, migrants can now pay these third parties and secure their investments.Those who find themselves back in Morocco after a boat has capsized or a police vessel has re-routed them, as happens more often than not, have the money to try again.For the smugglers who captained the boat on Feb. 4, a postponed departure would have meant approximately 96,000 euros returned. Another factor: The witness explained how smugglers often call for last-minute departures when bad weather is on the horizon, knowing storms make it easier to evade surveillance efforts by the Guardia Civil.Mamadou Aliou ""Barkley"" Diallo, 34.Credit: Courtesy of the familyWith an overcrowded boat and waves reaching three meters high, they capsized less than an hour into their journey. The passengers were thrown into freezing water without enough life jackets — many of them not knowing how to swim. The oldest reported passenger on board was 34, the youngest had just turned 14. There were at least eight women, one of them pregnant.Lone survivorTwo days after the tragedy, the Royal Navy of Morocco reported that, miraculously, one young man from Mali had been found alive. After a series of interrogations, he was accused of taking part in an illegal operation and is currently being held in police custody.The Nadori police told me they are continuing to search for the top-level smugglers thought to have masterminded this operation and many others like it.Oury Diallo, 18.Credit: Courtesy of the familyPhotographs, names and questions have poured in ever since. Along with them, I received final videos that were recorded by young men like Mamadou Diallo, 21, who tells his mother, “I’ve suffered greatly in my journey to Morocco, but it’s all been worthwhile because, soon, I’ll be calling you from Spain.”And Safourata Sow, 28, who tells her three daughters how much she loves them and misses them.Again and again, I listened to the words of Karim, who was one of the last boys I interviewed in person. Sitting by his makeshift tent he tells me, “We've traveled so far, we've been through so much, I finally understand what my brothers meant when they told me, 'I'll make it to Europe or I'll die trying.' After you've endured the horrors of this journey to Morocco, there's only one way home.”Mamadou Saliou Bah, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the familyGiven the lack of access to basic social services and the active fighting in some communities in West Africa, it is not uncommon to hear of boys like Karim traveling thousands of miles north in search of a way to support their families. Hassane and Houseine Traoré — 28-year-old twin brothers from Cote D’Ivoire — had a similar story to tell.“They were the coolest guys,” says an old friend, Stephanie Dokou, who grew up with them in Cote D’Ivoire. “They were the best athletes our village had ever seen, they played music and sang, they did well in school. All the girls loved them. We knew they would go on to do great things.”Jalloh ""JJ"" Thierno Bah, 26.Credit: Courtesy of the family“They were always together,” explains another old friend, Y’souf Bella. ""One never did anything without the other.”Including their final crossing to Europe. Both boarded the boat, neither body has been found. Their mother calls me every day in hopes I will have some other news. Although Hassane and Houseine were adored in their camp in Morocco, it was difficult for me to track down their actual names for this story, because everyone there knew the charismatic young men simply as “the twins.”The Traoré brothers were not the only twins, though. Alhassane Barry, 26, from Guinea was also on board.Mamadou Saliou Bah, 23.Credit: Courtesy of the family""Hassane was the quiet one. His twin was the outgoing one. Hassane always looked up to his brother, but, in a lot of ways, it was him who the rest of us admired,” said one of his closest friends, Mamadousaliou Diallo, who made it from Morocco to Europe last year.“They lost their father when they were young, and they were both devoted to their mother. She worked so hard to be able to send them to university, and they wanted to provide a better life for her. Hassane studied sociology. He was one of the best students in his class, but when he graduated, there was no work for him. In Guinea, it doesn’t matter how smart you are. If you’re not from a wealthy family, you won’t find a good job. He didn’t tell his brother he was leaving, because he didn’t want him to worry. I was the one who called him to tell him about the tragedy. I wanted him to hear it from a friend before he saw Hassane’s photo on Facebook. He couldn’t breathe. I remember him choking back his tears, saying, how am I going to tell our mother?”Ali Keita, 27.Credit: Courtesy of the family The youngest victimsBut not everyone had a family at home waiting for news of their safe crossing. Youssouf Diallo, 16, and her little brother, 14, who was the youngest reported passenger on board, left their home after losing both of their parents. In the camps, one of the little boy’s friends tells me he cried when he realized there was no one left to notify of their death.Youssouf’s friend, Fatima Diallo, also 16, says, “I made a flower necklace and burned it in the fire last night.

The closing of other primary routes to Europe in Libya, where migrants are now being bought and sold in an emergent slave trade, is pushing more people to Morocco’s borders.Houseine Traoré, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBut the steady reinforcement of the Spain-Morocco land border, which is now secured by three rings of 20-foot high razor-wire fences and under constant surveillance by the Guardia Civil, means even more are attempting treacherous sea crossings.According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the number of migrants reaching Spain by way of the Mediterranean tripled to nearly 22,000 last year, and the number of reported drownings off the Spanish coast doubled.

He left his home at the age of 15 and traveled more than 3,000 miles alone — from Guinea to Morocco. After his father died, he felt responsible for taking care of his younger brothers and sisters when his mother couldn’t find any way to support the family in their rural community. He wanted to give his siblings the chance to go to school like his father had given him.Ben Ali Bah, 24.Credit: Courtesy of the family“Karim was smart and brave and above all, he was generous,” one of his closest friends, Mamadou Bah, tells me over a crackling phone line. “He always struggled for the well-being of the group, even risking the dangers of going into the street to beg for us when we couldn't find enough food to eat. It was Karim who prepared the one daily meal for our brotherhood every night.”I posted a photograph of him and asked his friends in Morocco and Guinea to help me make him more than a number.“Karim studied hard before leaving home,” Thierno Jalloh wrote, “and he used his education to speak up for the other boys who didn't have any.

We had a ball we made out of plastic and tape.”Rough conditionsIn the hours before the first bodies were spotted, Karim, along with 46 men, women, and children coming from Guinea, Cote D’Ivoire, Cameroon, Senegal and Mali left their camp in Carrière. Their smugglers, two Moroccan men, were waiting for them on a rocky beach in Arekmane.Mamadou Billo Diallo, 25.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThey carried a small wooden fishing boat that had been rigged with an outboard motor down to the water.

But new systems created to protect migrants’ financial investments have made tragedies like this one significantly more likely. In 2016, I knew dozens of migrants who were devastated when they paid 1,500 to 2,500 euros and failed to reach the other side. This left them trapped in Morocco for many more years, struggling to save up enough money to try again.Amoudou Taibou Diallo, 16.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThis past summer, I noticed a niche market had emerged with some smugglers stepping into the business of transferring money from migrant to smuggler — only after they had safely reached Spanish soil.

The passengers were thrown into freezing water without enough life jackets — many of them not knowing how to swim. The oldest reported passenger on board was 34, the youngest had just turned 14. There were at least eight women, one of them pregnant.Lone survivorTwo days after the tragedy, the Royal Navy of Morocco reported that, miraculously, one young man from Mali had been found alive. After a series of interrogations, he was accused of taking part in an illegal operation and is currently being held in police custody.The Nadori police told me they are continuing to search for the top-level smugglers thought to have masterminded this operation and many others like it.Oury Diallo, 18.Credit: Courtesy of the familyPhotographs, names and questions have poured in ever since.

Sitting by his makeshift tent he tells me, “We've traveled so far, we've been through so much, I finally understand what my brothers meant when they told me, 'I'll make it to Europe or I'll die trying.' After you've endured the horrors of this journey to Morocco, there's only one way home.”Mamadou Saliou Bah, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the familyGiven the lack of access to basic social services and the active fighting in some communities in West Africa, it is not uncommon to hear of boys like Karim traveling thousands of miles north in search of a way to support their families. Hassane and Houseine Traoré — 28-year-old twin brothers from Cote D’Ivoire — had a similar story to tell.“They were the coolest guys,” says an old friend, Stephanie Dokou, who grew up with them in Cote D’Ivoire. “They were the best athletes our village had ever seen, they played music and sang, they did well in school. All the girls loved them. We knew they would go on to do great things.”Jalloh ""JJ"" Thierno Bah, 26.Credit: Courtesy of the family“They were always together,” explains another old friend, Y’souf Bella. ""One never did anything without the other.”Including their final crossing to Europe. Both boarded the boat, neither body has been found. Their mother calls me every day in hopes I will have some other news. Although Hassane and Houseine were adored in their camp in Morocco, it was difficult for me to track down their actual names for this story, because everyone there knew the charismatic young men simply as “the twins.”The Traoré brothers were not the only twins, though. Alhassane Barry, 26, from Guinea was also on board.Mamadou Saliou Bah, 23.Credit: Courtesy of the family""Hassane was the quiet one. His twin was the outgoing one. Hassane always looked up to his brother, but, in a lot of ways, it was him who the rest of us admired,” said one of his closest friends, Mamadousaliou Diallo, who made it from Morocco to Europe last year.“They lost their father when they were young, and they were both devoted to their mother. She worked so hard to be able to send them to university, and they wanted to provide a better life for her. Hassane studied sociology. He was one of the best students in his class, but when he graduated, there was no work for him. In Guinea, it doesn’t matter how smart you are. If you’re not from a wealthy family, you won’t find a good job. He didn’t tell his brother he was leaving, because he didn’t want him to worry. I was the one who called him to tell him about the tragedy. I wanted him to hear it from a friend before he saw Hassane’s photo on Facebook. He couldn’t breathe. I remember him choking back his tears, saying, how am I going to tell our mother?”Ali Keita, 27.Credit: Courtesy of the family The youngest victimsBut not everyone had a family at home waiting for news of their safe crossing. Youssouf Diallo, 16, and her little brother, 14, who was the youngest reported passenger on board, left their home after losing both of their parents. In the camps, one of the little boy’s friends tells me he cried when he realized there was no one left to notify of their death.Youssouf’s friend, Fatima Diallo, also 16, says, “I made a flower necklace and burned it in the fire last night. Youssouf and I used to make them together.”Some others had family waiting for them on the other side. Tahirou Barry, 24, from Guinea was one of them.""Junior,"" 29.Credit: Courtesy of the familyHis friend, Hady Cissé, tells me, “He had a beautiful woman waiting for him in France! She was the love of his life. They’d known each other since they were little and got married right after university. Tahirou saved up all of his money to help her get a student visa to study abroad after their wedding. They hoped to eventually both finish their studies in Europe, so they could return home and find jobs before having a family of their own. But Tahirou couldn’t wait another two years to see her, so her decided to cross through Morocco. He was counting the days until he would see her again. She didn’t know he had left.”Tidjane Bah, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the familyLike the newlyweds, Marlyatou Diallo, 26, was crossing to meet her husband, who made it to Germany last year and had fallen ill.“Marly wasn’t just my sister — she was the smartest, kindest woman I've ever known,” says Fatima, her older sister, who was watching Marly’s son for her until her return.  Her siblings passed the phone around, each sharing with me their memories of “the little one.”“She’ll be missed by all of us,” her brother, Barry, tells me, “But most of all, she’ll be missed by her husband and son, who she loved with all her heart. How can we explain to him how the world took his mother like this?”Marly’s Facebook page is filled with albums documenting every moment of her son’s life — from his first tooth to his most recent birthday — 5 years old last month.Oumou ""Belle"" Bah, 16.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThe last image she posted was perhaps an answer to her brother’s question — it read, “My son — I carried you for nine months in my body and I’ll carry you always in my heart. If there’s ever a day when I’m not beside you, know that my spirit is still there protecting you.”An incomplete listI have about 47 students in my lecture hall on Wednesday afternoons. Most of them are the same age as those smuggled across the rough waters of the Mediterranean at night. I have thought about how much attention would be devoted to remembering each of their lives if a tragedy of this proportion ever happened.Youssouf Diallo, 18.Credit: Courtesy of the familyFor the past two weeks, I have worked tirelessly collecting names and images, and yet I only have 39. There are still family members who don’t know if their loved ones are gone.Twenty-six lives will never be accounted for in official statistics because no effort was made to recover their bodies from the water. Sixteen of the 21 recovered bodies will soon be dumped in mass graves because no effort was made to identify them in the morgue.The states involved have no incentive to accurately report high death rates, and before reports can be corrected by media sources, a dozen others have occurred.Marlyatou ""Marly"" Diallo, 26.Credit: Courtesy of the familyIn the 24 hours following this tragedy, another boat carrying 39 migrants arrived safely at the Chafarinas Islands off the coast of Morocco, 94 migrants were reported dead in a capsized boat off the coat of Libya, and the Guardia Civil intercepted 31 migrants en route to Melilla. Migration across the Mediterranean is growing by the day.I hope people stop and look at the faces of Marly and Tahirou, Karim and Hassane, “the twins” and the siblings who had no parents to mourn them. I hope they see there were 47 individuals who packed what few belongings they had on their backs, handed their savings over to smugglers, and stepped onto a small wooden fishing boat to begin their lives. They were proud and eager, like students at graduation.Aminatou Diallo, 25.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBut no one was there to see all of the work it had taken for them to get to that final crossing — the thousands of miles journeyed across deserts and in the backs of trucks, the years spent sleeping on forest floors, the untold abuses suffered along the way. They stepped onto a boat carrying dreams of supporting their parents and siblings, partners and children.In all of the years I have spent working in migrant camps across North Africa, I have never met a single individual who wasn't there with the dream of helping someone else left behind. I don't think it's possible to endure the suffering they do unless you have that dream motivating you to reach the other side.Binta ""Bobo"" Baldé, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBefore the waves overthrew the boat, before he fought for one last breath, I imagine Karim was thinking of how long it might take him to save up for a real soccer ball and if the ground in Spain would feel anything like the ground at home.I hope people remember their stories the next time they read headlines about overcrowded boats and numbers, not names, of those lost at sea. The headlines never change, as if the same bodies are washing ashore again and again. But how could it be the same twins who brought music to their hidden camp, the same siblings who clung tightly to one another, the same big-hearted boy with dreams of being a soccer player?Those 47 are gone, soon to be replaced with others, proud and eager.Djenabou Bah, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the family Safourata ""Sofia"" Sow, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyKaissa Camara, 20.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAmadou Bah, 22. Credit: Courtesy of the familyAladji Abdoulaye Diallo, 27.Credit: Courtesy of the familyMamadou Aliou ""Barcley"" Bah, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThierno Bah, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAmadou Bailo Diallo, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the familyMamadou Dian Diallo, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAlpha Oumar Diallo, 19.CCredit: Courtesy of the family40 - 47 Name unknown",35.58318659,-2.795275034,Cabo Tres Forcas,Spain,PRI/PrivateSource/BBC/El Diario/Caminando/IOM/Al-M,http://bit.ly/2DuqHob,1,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,4113,Dorien,08-05-2018,New Entry,24/04/2018,Dorien

Hassane always looked up to his brother, but, in a lot of ways, it was him who the rest of us admired,” said one of his closest friends, Mamadousaliou Diallo, who made it from Morocco to Europe last year.“They lost their father when they were young, and they were both devoted to their mother. She worked so hard to be able to send them to university, and they wanted to provide a better life for her. Hassane studied sociology. He was one of the best students in his class, but when he graduated, there was no work for him. In Guinea, it doesn’t matter how smart you are. If you’re not from a wealthy family, you won’t find a good job. He didn’t tell his brother he was leaving, because he didn’t want him to worry. I was the one who called him to tell him about the tragedy. I wanted him to hear it from a friend before he saw Hassane’s photo on Facebook. He couldn’t breathe.

Some wore life jackets. But there were a lot of life jackets without any bodies inside. At first I saw just one body, then another and another and another. It was terrible. It’s a moment I’ll never forget.”Mamadou Laly ""Le Grand"" Barry, 30.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThis is the memory of the crew member who first alerted Spanish Maritime Rescue to a capsized boat on Feb. 4. He was working on a ferry en route to Melilla, one of two Spanish enclaves still remaining in northern Africa. The ferry is part of Trasmediterránea’s large fleet and makes a daily trip between Melilla and Almería, on the Spanish mainland, carrying up to 1,250 passengers on each crossing.Some 4,000 miles away, my cell phone started ringing. I spent most of the following week on the phone with families across West Africa who were desperately searching for any information about their loved ones.Tidiane Jalloh ""TJ""  Bah, 17.Credit: Courtesy of the familyMy son, is he alive? My wife, have they found her body yet? When will we know? How will we know? Is anyone looking for them?For tourists seeking a day-trip to Morocco, there are a host of ferry options from Spain — most take 30 minutes and cost 25 euros per passenger. For African migrants, refugees and asylum seekers seeking the chance at a better life in Europe, there are a host of smuggling options running the same routes in reverse. Most take a full day’s journey at sea and cost an average of 2,000 euros per passenger.Tahirou Barry, 22.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBoarding one of Trasmediterránea’s new ferries, you might notice a small sign warning you of seasickness. Boarding one of the small wooden fishing boats that smugglers captain from Morocco’s coast, migrants don’t need a sign warning them that, as one 15-year-old boy tells me, “You’ll make it to Europe or you’ll die trying.”A difficult processAfter being alerted to bodies floating in the open sea, Maritime Rescue sent a ship from Melilla to begin searching for survivors, and the Guardia Civil launched two smaller rescue missions as well. In the hours that followed, the Royal Navy of Morocco ended up recovering the majority of the bodies, which had drifted to their coastline by the time they responded.Mohammed Diallo, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThe officers placed 20 bodies in one massive, blue plastic bag made for tragedies like this and took them to El Hassani Hospital in Nador. The one body recovered by Spanish police was taken to Melilla. At the morgue, I was told recently, 16 of the 20 bodies remain unidentified.“We have a poster hanging in the police station in Nador with pictures of each face, so the families can identify them,"" an official said.But their families aren’t in Morocco, and the friends of these victims live hidden in forest camps that are routinely under attack by Moroccan police, who threaten to beat, imprison or deport anyone found. The lack of official reporting by Spain and Morocco means family members are left with more questions than answers, often learning about the passing of loved ones from Facebook posts months after an incident has occurred.Abdul Karim Barry, 17.Credit: Courtesy of the familyA short, dangerous crossingMorocco offers the shortest passage to Europe of any African country — less than eight miles across the Mediterranean Sea — and the Spanish enclaves of Melilla and Ceuta make it the only country on the African continent to share a land border with the internally borderless EU.It is one of the most trafficked border regions in the world right now, with the number of people attempting to escape violence and poverty across West and Central Africa growing daily. The closing of other primary routes to Europe in Libya, where migrants are now being bought and sold in an emergent slave trade, is pushing more people to Morocco’s borders.Houseine Traoré, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBut the steady reinforcement of the Spain-Morocco land border, which is now secured by three rings of 20-foot high razor-wire fences and under constant surveillance by the Guardia Civil, means even more are attempting treacherous sea crossings.According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the number of migrants reaching Spain by way of the Mediterranean tripled to nearly 22,000 last year, and the number of reported drownings off the Spanish coast doubled. However, the 223 drownings reported in 2017 only account for bodies that were recovered and identified.Hassane Traoré, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyLess than two months into 2018, there have already been 75 victims recovered, including the 21 found floating off the coast of Melilla last month. How many others remain in the water?No namesThe week of the incident, major news organizations from The New York Times to El Mundo covered the latest Mediterranean tragedy, but regardless of which source you follow, you read the same facts.Alpha Moron Diallo, 23.Credit: Courtesy of the familyTwenty-one bodies. All African migrants. All packed into a small wooden fishing boat that capsized off the coast of Morocco’s Spanish enclave.There was no follow-up as the victim count edged upward, ultimately winding up more than double what was originally reported.As I followed the coverage by various sources, I noticed there was never a single name released.Who are all of these people, assigned numbers, not names, in the morgue? Where were they coming from, what had driven them to their final crossing, and what had they expected to find on the other side?Alhassane Barry, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyI needed more than a number. I didn’t want to simply break the news that it was 47 migrants and two smugglers, not 21 people, who were lost at sea. I wanted to report who had been lost. I enlisted the migrants still living in Morocco’s hidden camps to help me collect names, faces and stories. They knew better than anyone the group who left just after nightfall on Feb. 3 to walk 16 miles to the meeting point their smugglers had given them.An anthropologist by training, I started working on issues of migration and international human rights a decade ago and have spent many years living in the hundreds of makeshift camps around primary departure points in Morocco, Algeria and Libya. The first time I gained access to Carrière — one of Morocco’s largest and most tightly controlled camps — was when I was working on another story for PRI in the summer of 2016.Amoudoubailo Diallo, 20.Credit: Courtesy of the familyIt was a complicated process requiring permitting at the governmental level and clearance at the local level — from the smuggling rings that control the space and the brotherhoods of migrants themselves.I spent the following year in the region finishing a documentary film that captures the journeys of three migrants from Guinea, Mali and the DRC to their final attempted crossings. I was back in Carrière as recently as last month. In fact, I had only been back in the US for a week when I received my first phone call alerting me to the capsized boat carrying people I knew well.Bouboucar Bah, 32.Credit: Courtesy of the family'Smart, brave, generous'The photograph of Abdul Karim Barry — a 17-year-old boy from Guinea — was one of the first I saw.Karim had been in Carrière awaiting his chance at crossing for over two years. He left his home at the age of 15 and traveled more than 3,000 miles alone — from Guinea to Morocco. After his father died, he felt responsible for taking care of his younger brothers and sisters when his mother couldn’t find any way to support the family in their rural community. He wanted to give his siblings the chance to go to school like his father had given him.Ben Ali Bah, 24.Credit: Courtesy of the family“Karim was smart and brave and above all, he was generous,” one of his closest friends, Mamadou Bah, tells me over a crackling phone line. “He always struggled for the well-being of the group, even risking the dangers of going into the street to beg for us when we couldn't find enough food to eat. It was Karim who prepared the one daily meal for our brotherhood every night.”I posted a photograph of him and asked his friends in Morocco and Guinea to help me make him more than a number.“Karim studied hard before leaving home,” Thierno Jalloh wrote, “and he used his education to speak up for the other boys who didn't have any. He was young, but he was a natural leader with a big heart. He couldn’t stand for anyone to be treated as less than human because of the color of their skin.”Alpha ""Bambino"" Bah, 14.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAbdoulaye Barry wrote, “He told me he dreamed of becoming a soccer player when he was little. He played on a team in Guinea, and he was really good. But as you grow older, you realize some of your dreams won’t ever be realized. Still, Karim played with me in the forest sometimes. We had a ball we made out of plastic and tape.”Rough conditionsIn the hours before the first bodies were spotted, Karim, along with 46 men, women, and children coming from Guinea, Cote D’Ivoire, Cameroon, Senegal and Mali left their camp in Carrière. Their smugglers, two Moroccan men, were waiting for them on a rocky beach in Arekmane.Mamadou Billo Diallo, 25.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThey carried a small wooden fishing boat that had been rigged with an outboard motor down to the water. A witness who traveled with the migrants but didn’t board the boat that night said the winds were too strong for a safe crossing — 50 mph, according to official reports.So why would smugglers choose to travel, risking their own lives, under such rough conditions?In previous years, they wouldn’t have. But new systems created to protect migrants’ financial investments have made tragedies like this one significantly more likely. In 2016, I knew dozens of migrants who were devastated when they paid 1,500 to 2,500 euros and failed to reach the other side. This left them trapped in Morocco for many more years, struggling to save up enough money to try again.Amoudou Taibou Diallo, 16.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThis past summer, I noticed a niche market had emerged with some smugglers stepping into the business of transferring money from migrant to smuggler — only after they had safely reached Spanish soil. For a 10 percent increase in fee, migrants can now pay these third parties and secure their investments.Those who find themselves back in Morocco after a boat has capsized or a police vessel has re-routed them, as happens more often than not, have the money to try again.For the smugglers who captained the boat on Feb. 4, a postponed departure would have meant approximately 96,000 euros returned. Another factor: The witness explained how smugglers often call for last-minute departures when bad weather is on the horizon, knowing storms make it easier to evade surveillance efforts by the Guardia Civil.Mamadou Aliou ""Barkley"" Diallo, 34.Credit: Courtesy of the familyWith an overcrowded boat and waves reaching three meters high, they capsized less than an hour into their journey. The passengers were thrown into freezing water without enough life jackets — many of them not knowing how to swim. The oldest reported passenger on board was 34, the youngest had just turned 14. There were at least eight women, one of them pregnant.Lone survivorTwo days after the tragedy, the Royal Navy of Morocco reported that, miraculously, one young man from Mali had been found alive. After a series of interrogations, he was accused of taking part in an illegal operation and is currently being held in police custody.The Nadori police told me they are continuing to search for the top-level smugglers thought to have masterminded this operation and many others like it.Oury Diallo, 18.Credit: Courtesy of the familyPhotographs, names and questions have poured in ever since. Along with them, I received final videos that were recorded by young men like Mamadou Diallo, 21, who tells his mother, “I’ve suffered greatly in my journey to Morocco, but it’s all been worthwhile because, soon, I’ll be calling you from Spain.”And Safourata Sow, 28, who tells her three daughters how much she loves them and misses them.Again and again, I listened to the words of Karim, who was one of the last boys I interviewed in person. Sitting by his makeshift tent he tells me, “We've traveled so far, we've been through so much, I finally understand what my brothers meant when they told me, 'I'll make it to Europe or I'll die trying.' After you've endured the horrors of this journey to Morocco, there's only one way home.”Mamadou Saliou Bah, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the familyGiven the lack of access to basic social services and the active fighting in some communities in West Africa, it is not uncommon to hear of boys like Karim traveling thousands of miles north in search of a way to support their families. Hassane and Houseine Traoré — 28-year-old twin brothers from Cote D’Ivoire — had a similar story to tell.“They were the coolest guys,” says an old friend, Stephanie Dokou, who grew up with them in Cote D’Ivoire. “They were the best athletes our village had ever seen, they played music and sang, they did well in school.

The ferry is part of Trasmediterránea’s large fleet and makes a daily trip between Melilla and Almería, on the Spanish mainland, carrying up to 1,250 passengers on each crossing.Some 4,000 miles away, my cell phone started ringing. I spent most of the following week on the phone with families across West Africa who were desperately searching for any information about their loved ones.Tidiane Jalloh ""TJ""  Bah, 17.Credit: Courtesy of the familyMy son, is he alive? My wife, have they found her body yet? When will we know? How will we know? Is anyone looking for them?For tourists seeking a day-trip to Morocco, there are a host of ferry options from Spain — most take 30 minutes and cost 25 euros per passenger. For African migrants, refugees and asylum seekers seeking the chance at a better life in Europe, there are a host of smuggling options running the same routes in reverse. Most take a full day’s journey at sea and cost an average of 2,000 euros per passenger.Tahirou Barry, 22.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBoarding one of Trasmediterránea’s new ferries, you might notice a small sign warning you of seasickness. Boarding one of the small wooden fishing boats that smugglers captain from Morocco’s coast, migrants don’t need a sign warning them that, as one 15-year-old boy tells me, “You’ll make it to Europe or you’ll die trying.”A difficult processAfter being alerted to bodies floating in the open sea, Maritime Rescue sent a ship from Melilla to begin searching for survivors, and the Guardia Civil launched two smaller rescue missions as well. In the hours that followed, the Royal Navy of Morocco ended up recovering the majority of the bodies, which had drifted to their coastline by the time they responded.Mohammed Diallo, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThe officers placed 20 bodies in one massive, blue plastic bag made for tragedies like this and took them to El Hassani Hospital in Nador. The one body recovered by Spanish police was taken to Melilla. At the morgue, I was told recently, 16 of the 20 bodies remain unidentified.“We have a poster hanging in the police station in Nador with pictures of each face, so the families can identify them,"" an official said.But their families aren’t in Morocco, and the friends of these victims live hidden in forest camps that are routinely under attack by Moroccan police, who threaten to beat, imprison or deport anyone found. The lack of official reporting by Spain and Morocco means family members are left with more questions than answers, often learning about the passing of loved ones from Facebook posts months after an incident has occurred.Abdul Karim Barry, 17.Credit: Courtesy of the familyA short, dangerous crossingMorocco offers the shortest passage to Europe of any African country — less than eight miles across the Mediterranean Sea — and the Spanish enclaves of Melilla and Ceuta make it the only country on the African continent to share a land border with the internally borderless EU.It is one of the most trafficked border regions in the world right now, with the number of people attempting to escape violence and poverty across West and Central Africa growing daily. The closing of other primary routes to Europe in Libya, where migrants are now being bought and sold in an emergent slave trade, is pushing more people to Morocco’s borders.Houseine Traoré, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBut the steady reinforcement of the Spain-Morocco land border, which is now secured by three rings of 20-foot high razor-wire fences and under constant surveillance by the Guardia Civil, means even more are attempting treacherous sea crossings.According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the number of migrants reaching Spain by way of the Mediterranean tripled to nearly 22,000 last year, and the number of reported drownings off the Spanish coast doubled.

He left his home at the age of 15 and traveled more than 3,000 miles alone — from Guinea to Morocco. After his father died, he felt responsible for taking care of his younger brothers and sisters when his mother couldn’t find any way to support the family in their rural community. He wanted to give his siblings the chance to go to school like his father had given him.Ben Ali Bah, 24.Credit: Courtesy of the family“Karim was smart and brave and above all, he was generous,” one of his closest friends, Mamadou Bah, tells me over a crackling phone line. “He always struggled for the well-being of the group, even risking the dangers of going into the street to beg for us when we couldn't find enough food to eat. It was Karim who prepared the one daily meal for our brotherhood every night.”I posted a photograph of him and asked his friends in Morocco and Guinea to help me make him more than a number.“Karim studied hard before leaving home,” Thierno Jalloh wrote, “and he used his education to speak up for the other boys who didn't have any. He was young, but he was a natural leader with a big heart. He couldn’t stand for anyone to be treated as less than human because of the color of their skin.”Alpha ""Bambino"" Bah, 14.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAbdoulaye Barry wrote, “He told me he dreamed of becoming a soccer player when he was little. He played on a team in Guinea, and he was really good. But as you grow older, you realize some of your dreams won’t ever be realized. Still, Karim played with me in the forest sometimes. We had a ball we made out of plastic and tape.”Rough conditionsIn the hours before the first bodies were spotted, Karim, along with 46 men, women, and children coming from Guinea, Cote D’Ivoire, Cameroon, Senegal and Mali left their camp in Carrière. Their smugglers, two Moroccan men, were waiting for them on a rocky beach in Arekmane.Mamadou Billo Diallo, 25.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThey carried a small wooden fishing boat that had been rigged with an outboard motor down to the water. A witness who traveled with the migrants but didn’t board the boat that night said the winds were too strong for a safe crossing — 50 mph, according to official reports.So why would smugglers choose to travel, risking their own lives, under such rough conditions?In previous years, they wouldn’t have. But new systems created to protect migrants’ financial investments have made tragedies like this one significantly more likely. In 2016, I knew dozens of migrants who were devastated when they paid 1,500 to 2,500 euros and failed to reach the other side. This left them trapped in Morocco for many more years, struggling to save up enough money to try again.Amoudou Taibou Diallo, 16.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThis past summer, I noticed a niche market had emerged with some smugglers stepping into the business of transferring money from migrant to smuggler — only after they had safely reached Spanish soil. For a 10 percent increase in fee, migrants can now pay these third parties and secure their investments.Those who find themselves back in Morocco after a boat has capsized or a police vessel has re-routed them, as happens more often than not, have the money to try again.For the smugglers who captained the boat on Feb. 4, a postponed departure would have meant approximately 96,000 euros returned. Another factor: The witness explained how smugglers often call for last-minute departures when bad weather is on the horizon, knowing storms make it easier to evade surveillance efforts by the Guardia Civil.Mamadou Aliou ""Barkley"" Diallo, 34.Credit: Courtesy of the familyWith an overcrowded boat and waves reaching three meters high, they capsized less than an hour into their journey. The passengers were thrown into freezing water without enough life jackets — many of them not knowing how to swim. The oldest reported passenger on board was 34, the youngest had just turned 14. There were at least eight women, one of them pregnant.Lone survivorTwo days after the tragedy, the Royal Navy of Morocco reported that, miraculously, one young man from Mali had been found alive. After a series of interrogations, he was accused of taking part in an illegal operation and is currently being held in police custody.The Nadori police told me they are continuing to search for the top-level smugglers thought to have masterminded this operation and many others like it.Oury Diallo, 18.Credit: Courtesy of the familyPhotographs, names and questions have poured in ever since. Along with them, I received final videos that were recorded by young men like Mamadou Diallo, 21, who tells his mother, “I’ve suffered greatly in my journey to Morocco, but it’s all been worthwhile because, soon, I’ll be calling you from Spain.”And Safourata Sow, 28, who tells her three daughters how much she loves them and misses them.Again and again, I listened to the words of Karim, who was one of the last boys I interviewed in person. Sitting by his makeshift tent he tells me, “We've traveled so far, we've been through so much, I finally understand what my brothers meant when they told me, 'I'll make it to Europe or I'll die trying.' After you've endured the horrors of this journey to Morocco, there's only one way home.”Mamadou Saliou Bah, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the familyGiven the lack of access to basic social services and the active fighting in some communities in West Africa, it is not uncommon to hear of boys like Karim traveling thousands of miles north in search of a way to support their families. Hassane and Houseine Traoré — 28-year-old twin brothers from Cote D’Ivoire — had a similar story to tell.“They were the coolest guys,” says an old friend, Stephanie Dokou, who grew up with them in Cote D’Ivoire. “They were the best athletes our village had ever seen, they played music and sang, they did well in school. All the girls loved them. We knew they would go on to do great things.”Jalloh ""JJ"" Thierno Bah, 26.Credit: Courtesy of the family“They were always together,” explains another old friend, Y’souf Bella. ""One never did anything without the other.”Including their final crossing to Europe. Both boarded the boat, neither body has been found. Their mother calls me every day in hopes I will have some other news. Although Hassane and Houseine were adored in their camp in Morocco, it was difficult for me to track down their actual names for this story, because everyone there knew the charismatic young men simply as “the twins.”The Traoré brothers were not the only twins, though. Alhassane Barry, 26, from Guinea was also on board.Mamadou Saliou Bah, 23.Credit: Courtesy of the family""Hassane was the quiet one. His twin was the outgoing one. Hassane always looked up to his brother, but, in a lot of ways, it was him who the rest of us admired,” said one of his closest friends, Mamadousaliou Diallo, who made it from Morocco to Europe last year.“They lost their father when they were young, and they were both devoted to their mother. She worked so hard to be able to send them to university, and they wanted to provide a better life for her. Hassane studied sociology. He was one of the best students in his class, but when he graduated, there was no work for him. In Guinea, it doesn’t matter how smart you are. If you’re not from a wealthy family, you won’t find a good job. He didn’t tell his brother he was leaving, because he didn’t want him to worry. I was the one who called him to tell him about the tragedy. I wanted him to hear it from a friend before he saw Hassane’s photo on Facebook. He couldn’t breathe. I remember him choking back his tears, saying, how am I going to tell our mother?”Ali Keita, 27.Credit: Courtesy of the family The youngest victimsBut not everyone had a family at home waiting for news of their safe crossing. Youssouf Diallo, 16, and her little brother, 14, who was the youngest reported passenger on board, left their home after losing both of their parents. In the camps, one of the little boy’s friends tells me he cried when he realized there was no one left to notify of their death.Youssouf’s friend, Fatima Diallo, also 16, says, “I made a flower necklace and burned it in the fire last night. Youssouf and I used to make them together.”Some others had family waiting for them on the other side. Tahirou Barry, 24, from Guinea was one of them.""Junior,"" 29.Credit: Courtesy of the familyHis friend, Hady Cissé, tells me, “He had a beautiful woman waiting for him in France! She was the love of his life. They’d known each other since they were little and got married right after university. Tahirou saved up all of his money to help her get a student visa to study abroad after their wedding. They hoped to eventually both finish their studies in Europe, so they could return home and find jobs before having a family of their own. But Tahirou couldn’t wait another two years to see her, so her decided to cross through Morocco. He was counting the days until he would see her again. She didn’t know he had left.”Tidjane Bah, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the familyLike the newlyweds, Marlyatou Diallo, 26, was crossing to meet her husband, who made it to Germany last year and had fallen ill.“Marly wasn’t just my sister — she was the smartest, kindest woman I've ever known,” says Fatima, her older sister, who was watching Marly’s son for her until her return.  Her siblings passed the phone around, each sharing with me their memories of “the little one.”“She’ll be missed by all of us,” her brother, Barry, tells me, “But most of all, she’ll be missed by her husband and son, who she loved with all her heart. How can we explain to him how the world took his mother like this?”Marly’s Facebook page is filled with albums documenting every moment of her son’s life — from his first tooth to his most recent birthday — 5 years old last month.Oumou ""Belle"" Bah, 16.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThe last image she posted was perhaps an answer to her brother’s question — it read, “My son — I carried you for nine months in my body and I’ll carry you always in my heart. If there’s ever a day when I’m not beside you, know that my spirit is still there protecting you.”An incomplete listI have about 47 students in my lecture hall on Wednesday afternoons. Most of them are the same age as those smuggled across the rough waters of the Mediterranean at night. I have thought about how much attention would be devoted to remembering each of their lives if a tragedy of this proportion ever happened.Youssouf Diallo, 18.Credit: Courtesy of the familyFor the past two weeks, I have worked tirelessly collecting names and images, and yet I only have 39. There are still family members who don’t know if their loved ones are gone.Twenty-six lives will never be accounted for in official statistics because no effort was made to recover their bodies from the water. Sixteen of the 21 recovered bodies will soon be dumped in mass graves because no effort was made to identify them in the morgue.The states involved have no incentive to accurately report high death rates, and before reports can be corrected by media sources, a dozen others have occurred.Marlyatou ""Marly"" Diallo, 26.Credit: Courtesy of the familyIn the 24 hours following this tragedy, another boat carrying 39 migrants arrived safely at the Chafarinas Islands off the coast of Morocco, 94 migrants were reported dead in a capsized boat off the coat of Libya, and the Guardia Civil intercepted 31 migrants en route to Melilla. Migration across the Mediterranean is growing by the day.I hope people stop and look at the faces of Marly and Tahirou, Karim and Hassane, “the twins” and the siblings who had no parents to mourn them. I hope they see there were 47 individuals who packed what few belongings they had on their backs, handed their savings over to smugglers, and stepped onto a small wooden fishing boat to begin their lives. They were proud and eager, like students at graduation.Aminatou Diallo, 25.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBut no one was there to see all of the work it had taken for them to get to that final crossing — the thousands of miles journeyed across deserts and in the backs of trucks, the years spent sleeping on forest floors, the untold abuses suffered along the way. They stepped onto a boat carrying dreams of supporting their parents and siblings, partners and children.In all of the years I have spent working in migrant camps across North Africa, I have never met a single individual who wasn't there with the dream of helping someone else left behind. I don't think it's possible to endure the suffering they do unless you have that dream motivating you to reach the other side.Binta ""Bobo"" Baldé, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBefore the waves overthrew the boat, before he fought for one last breath, I imagine Karim was thinking of how long it might take him to save up for a real soccer ball and if the ground in Spain would feel anything like the ground at home.I hope people remember their stories the next time they read headlines about overcrowded boats and numbers, not names, of those lost at sea. The headlines never change, as if the same bodies are washing ashore again and again. But how could it be the same twins who brought music to their hidden camp, the same siblings who clung tightly to one another, the same big-hearted boy with dreams of being a soccer player?Those 47 are gone, soon to be replaced with others, proud and eager.Djenabou Bah, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the family Safourata ""Sofia"" Sow, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyKaissa Camara, 20.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAmadou Bah, 22. Credit: Courtesy of the familyAladji Abdoulaye Diallo, 27.Credit: Courtesy of the familyMamadou Aliou ""Barcley"" Bah, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThierno Bah, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAmadou Bailo Diallo, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the familyMamadou Dian Diallo, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAlpha Oumar Diallo, 19.CCredit: Courtesy of the family40 - 47 Name unknown",35.58318659,-2.795275034,Cabo Tres Forcas,Spain,PRI/PrivateSource/BBC/El Diario/Caminando/IOM/Al-M,http://bit.ly/2DuqHob,1,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,4116,Dorien,08-05-2018,New Entry,24/04/2018,Dorien

Some wore life jackets. But there were a lot of life jackets without any bodies inside. At first I saw just one body, then another and another and another. It was terrible. It’s a moment I’ll never forget.”Mamadou Laly ""Le Grand"" Barry, 30.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThis is the memory of the crew member who first alerted Spanish Maritime Rescue to a capsized boat on Feb. 4. He was working on a ferry en route to Melilla, one of two Spanish enclaves still remaining in northern Africa. The ferry is part of Trasmediterránea’s large fleet and makes a daily trip between Melilla and Almería, on the Spanish mainland, carrying up to 1,250 passengers on each crossing.Some 4,000 miles away, my cell phone started ringing. I spent most of the following week on the phone with families across West Africa who were desperately searching for any information about their loved ones.Tidiane Jalloh ""TJ""  Bah, 17.Credit: Courtesy of the familyMy son, is he alive? My wife, have they found her body yet? When will we know? How will we know? Is anyone looking for them?For tourists seeking a day-trip to Morocco, there are a host of ferry options from Spain — most take 30 minutes and cost 25 euros per passenger. For African migrants, refugees and asylum seekers seeking the chance at a better life in Europe, there are a host of smuggling options running the same routes in reverse. Most take a full day’s journey at sea and cost an average of 2,000 euros per passenger.Tahirou Barry, 22.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBoarding one of Trasmediterránea’s new ferries, you might notice a small sign warning you of seasickness. Boarding one of the small wooden fishing boats that smugglers captain from Morocco’s coast, migrants don’t need a sign warning them that, as one 15-year-old boy tells me, “You’ll make it to Europe or you’ll die trying.”A difficult processAfter being alerted to bodies floating in the open sea, Maritime Rescue sent a ship from Melilla to begin searching for survivors, and the Guardia Civil launched two smaller rescue missions as well. In the hours that followed, the Royal Navy of Morocco ended up recovering the majority of the bodies, which had drifted to their coastline by the time they responded.Mohammed Diallo, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThe officers placed 20 bodies in one massive, blue plastic bag made for tragedies like this and took them to El Hassani Hospital in Nador. The one body recovered by Spanish police was taken to Melilla. At the morgue, I was told recently, 16 of the 20 bodies remain unidentified.“We have a poster hanging in the police station in Nador with pictures of each face, so the families can identify them,"" an official said.But their families aren’t in Morocco, and the friends of these victims live hidden in forest camps that are routinely under attack by Moroccan police, who threaten to beat, imprison or deport anyone found. The lack of official reporting by Spain and Morocco means family members are left with more questions than answers, often learning about the passing of loved ones from Facebook posts months after an incident has occurred.Abdul Karim Barry, 17.Credit: Courtesy of the familyA short, dangerous crossingMorocco offers the shortest passage to Europe of any African country — less than eight miles across the Mediterranean Sea — and the Spanish enclaves of Melilla and Ceuta make it the only country on the African continent to share a land border with the internally borderless EU.It is one of the most trafficked border regions in the world right now, with the number of people attempting to escape violence and poverty across West and Central Africa growing daily. The closing of other primary routes to Europe in Libya, where migrants are now being bought and sold in an emergent slave trade, is pushing more people to Morocco’s borders.Houseine Traoré, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBut the steady reinforcement of the Spain-Morocco land border, which is now secured by three rings of 20-foot high razor-wire fences and under constant surveillance by the Guardia Civil, means even more are attempting treacherous sea crossings.According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the number of migrants reaching Spain by way of the Mediterranean tripled to nearly 22,000 last year, and the number of reported drownings off the Spanish coast doubled. However, the 223 drownings reported in 2017 only account for bodies that were recovered and identified.Hassane Traoré, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyLess than two months into 2018, there have already been 75 victims recovered, including the 21 found floating off the coast of Melilla last month.

All African migrants. All packed into a small wooden fishing boat that capsized off the coast of Morocco’s Spanish enclave.There was no follow-up as the victim count edged upward, ultimately winding up more than double what was originally reported.As I followed the coverage by various sources, I noticed there was never a single name released.Who are all of these people, assigned numbers, not names, in the morgue? Where were they coming from, what had driven them to their final crossing, and what had they expected to find on the other side?Alhassane Barry, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyI needed more than a number. I didn’t want to simply break the news that it was 47 migrants and two smugglers, not 21 people, who were lost at sea. I wanted to report who had been lost. I enlisted the migrants still living in Morocco’s hidden camps to help me collect names, faces and stories. They knew better than anyone the group who left just after nightfall on Feb. 3 to walk 16 miles to the meeting point their smugglers had given them.An anthropologist by training, I started working on issues of migration and international human rights a decade ago and have spent many years living in the hundreds of makeshift camps around primary departure points in Morocco, Algeria and Libya. The first time I gained access to Carrière — one of Morocco’s largest and most tightly controlled camps — was when I was working on another story for PRI in the summer of 2016.Amoudoubailo Diallo, 20.Credit: Courtesy of the familyIt was a complicated process requiring permitting at the governmental level and clearance at the local level — from the smuggling rings that control the space and the brotherhoods of migrants themselves.I spent the following year in the region finishing a documentary film that captures the journeys of three migrants from Guinea, Mali and the DRC to their final attempted crossings. I was back in Carrière as recently as last month. In fact, I had only been back in the US for a week when I received my first phone call alerting me to the capsized boat carrying people I knew well.Bouboucar Bah, 32.Credit: Courtesy of the family'Smart, brave, generous'The photograph of Abdul Karim Barry — a 17-year-old boy from Guinea — was one of the first I saw.Karim had been in Carrière awaiting his chance at crossing for over two years. He left his home at the age of 15 and traveled more than 3,000 miles alone — from Guinea to Morocco. After his father died, he felt responsible for taking care of his younger brothers and sisters when his mother couldn’t find any way to support the family in their rural community. He wanted to give his siblings the chance to go to school like his father had given him.Ben Ali Bah, 24.Credit: Courtesy of the family“Karim was smart and brave and above all, he was generous,” one of his closest friends, Mamadou Bah, tells me over a crackling phone line. “He always struggled for the well-being of the group, even risking the dangers of going into the street to beg for us when we couldn't find enough food to eat. It was Karim who prepared the one daily meal for our brotherhood every night.”I posted a photograph of him and asked his friends in Morocco and Guinea to help me make him more than a number.“Karim studied hard before leaving home,” Thierno Jalloh wrote, “and he used his education to speak up for the other boys who didn't have any. He was young, but he was a natural leader with a big heart. He couldn’t stand for anyone to be treated as less than human because of the color of their skin.”Alpha ""Bambino"" Bah, 14.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAbdoulaye Barry wrote, “He told me he dreamed of becoming a soccer player when he was little. He played on a team in Guinea, and he was really good. But as you grow older, you realize some of your dreams won’t ever be realized. Still, Karim played with me in the forest sometimes. We had a ball we made out of plastic and tape.”Rough conditionsIn the hours before the first bodies were spotted, Karim, along with 46 men, women, and children coming from Guinea, Cote D’Ivoire, Cameroon, Senegal and Mali left their camp in Carrière. Their smugglers, two Moroccan men, were waiting for them on a rocky beach in Arekmane.Mamadou Billo Diallo, 25.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThey carried a small wooden fishing boat that had been rigged with an outboard motor down to the water. A witness who traveled with the migrants but didn’t board the boat that night said the winds were too strong for a safe crossing — 50 mph, according to official reports.So why would smugglers choose to travel, risking their own lives, under such rough conditions?In previous years, they wouldn’t have. But new systems created to protect migrants’ financial investments have made tragedies like this one significantly more likely. In 2016, I knew dozens of migrants who were devastated when they paid 1,500 to 2,500 euros and failed to reach the other side. This left them trapped in Morocco for many more years, struggling to save up enough money to try again.Amoudou Taibou Diallo, 16.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThis past summer, I noticed a niche market had emerged with some smugglers stepping into the business of transferring money from migrant to smuggler — only after they had safely reached Spanish soil.

It’s a moment I’ll never forget.”Mamadou Laly ""Le Grand"" Barry, 30.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThis is the memory of the crew member who first alerted Spanish Maritime Rescue to a capsized boat on Feb. 4. He was working on a ferry en route to Melilla, one of two Spanish enclaves still remaining in northern Africa. The ferry is part of Trasmediterránea’s large fleet and makes a daily trip between Melilla and Almería, on the Spanish mainland, carrying up to 1,250 passengers on each crossing.Some 4,000 miles away, my cell phone started ringing.

My wife, have they found her body yet? When will we know? How will we know? Is anyone looking for them?For tourists seeking a day-trip to Morocco, there are a host of ferry options from Spain — most take 30 minutes and cost 25 euros per passenger. For African migrants, refugees and asylum seekers seeking the chance at a better life in Europe, there are a host of smuggling options running the same routes in reverse. Most take a full day’s journey at sea and cost an average of 2,000 euros per passenger.Tahirou Barry, 22.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBoarding one of Trasmediterránea’s new ferries, you might notice a small sign warning you of seasickness. Boarding one of the small wooden fishing boats that smugglers captain from Morocco’s coast, migrants don’t need a sign warning them that, as one 15-year-old boy tells me, “You’ll make it to Europe or you’ll die trying.”A difficult processAfter being alerted to bodies floating in the open sea, Maritime Rescue sent a ship from Melilla to begin searching for survivors, and the Guardia Civil launched two smaller rescue missions as well. In the hours that followed, the Royal Navy of Morocco ended up recovering the majority of the bodies, which had drifted to their coastline by the time they responded.Mohammed Diallo, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThe officers placed 20 bodies in one massive, blue plastic bag made for tragedies like this and took them to El Hassani Hospital in Nador.

The lack of official reporting by Spain and Morocco means family members are left with more questions than answers, often learning about the passing of loved ones from Facebook posts months after an incident has occurred.Abdul Karim Barry, 17.Credit: Courtesy of the familyA short, dangerous crossingMorocco offers the shortest passage to Europe of any African country — less than eight miles across the Mediterranean Sea — and the Spanish enclaves of Melilla and Ceuta make it the only country on the African continent to share a land border with the internally borderless EU.It is one of the most trafficked border regions in the world right now, with the number of people attempting to escape violence and poverty across West and Central Africa growing daily. The closing of other primary routes to Europe in Libya, where migrants are now being bought and sold in an emergent slave trade, is pushing more people to Morocco’s borders.Houseine Traoré, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBut the steady reinforcement of the Spain-Morocco land border, which is now secured by three rings of 20-foot high razor-wire fences and under constant surveillance by the Guardia Civil, means even more are attempting treacherous sea crossings.According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the number of migrants reaching Spain by way of the Mediterranean tripled to nearly 22,000 last year, and the number of reported drownings off the Spanish coast doubled. However, the 223 drownings reported in 2017 only account for bodies that were recovered and identified.Hassane Traoré, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyLess than two months into 2018, there have already been 75 victims recovered, including the 21 found floating off the coast of Melilla last month.

I didn’t want to simply break the news that it was 47 migrants and two smugglers, not 21 people, who were lost at sea. I wanted to report who had been lost. I enlisted the migrants still living in Morocco’s hidden camps to help me collect names, faces and stories. They knew better than anyone the group who left just after nightfall on Feb. 3 to walk 16 miles to the meeting point their smugglers had given them.An anthropologist by training, I started working on issues of migration and international human rights a decade ago and have spent many years living in the hundreds of makeshift camps around primary departure points in Morocco, Algeria and Libya. The first time I gained access to Carrière — one of Morocco’s largest and most tightly controlled camps — was when I was working on another story for PRI in the summer of 2016.Amoudoubailo Diallo, 20.Credit: Courtesy of the familyIt was a complicated process requiring permitting at the governmental level and clearance at the local level — from the smuggling rings that control the space and the brotherhoods of migrants themselves.I spent the following year in the region finishing a documentary film that captures the journeys of three migrants from Guinea, Mali and the DRC to their final attempted crossings. I was back in Carrière as recently as last month. In fact, I had only been back in the US for a week when I received my first phone call alerting me to the capsized boat carrying people I knew well.Bouboucar Bah, 32.Credit: Courtesy of the family'Smart, brave, generous'The photograph of Abdul Karim Barry — a 17-year-old boy from Guinea — was one of the first I saw.Karim had been in Carrière awaiting his chance at crossing for over two years. He left his home at the age of 15 and traveled more than 3,000 miles alone — from Guinea to Morocco. After his father died, he felt responsible for taking care of his younger brothers and sisters when his mother couldn’t find any way to support the family in their rural community. He wanted to give his siblings the chance to go to school like his father had given him.Ben Ali Bah, 24.Credit: Courtesy of the family“Karim was smart and brave and above all, he was generous,” one of his closest friends, Mamadou Bah, tells me over a crackling phone line. “He always struggled for the well-being of the group, even risking the dangers of going into the street to beg for us when we couldn't find enough food to eat. It was Karim who prepared the one daily meal for our brotherhood every night.”I posted a photograph of him and asked his friends in Morocco and Guinea to help me make him more than a number.“Karim studied hard before leaving home,” Thierno Jalloh wrote, “and he used his education to speak up for the other boys who didn't have any. He was young, but he was a natural leader with a big heart. He couldn’t stand for anyone to be treated as less than human because of the color of their skin.”Alpha ""Bambino"" Bah, 14.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAbdoulaye Barry wrote, “He told me he dreamed of becoming a soccer player when he was little. He played on a team in Guinea, and he was really good. But as you grow older, you realize some of your dreams won’t ever be realized. Still, Karim played with me in the forest sometimes. We had a ball we made out of plastic and tape.”Rough conditionsIn the hours before the first bodies were spotted, Karim, along with 46 men, women, and children coming from Guinea, Cote D’Ivoire, Cameroon, Senegal and Mali left their camp in Carrière. Their smugglers, two Moroccan men, were waiting for them on a rocky beach in Arekmane.Mamadou Billo Diallo, 25.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThey carried a small wooden fishing boat that had been rigged with an outboard motor down to the water. A witness who traveled with the migrants but didn’t board the boat that night said the winds were too strong for a safe crossing — 50 mph, according to official reports.So why would smugglers choose to travel, risking their own lives, under such rough conditions?In previous years, they wouldn’t have. But new systems created to protect migrants’ financial investments have made tragedies like this one significantly more likely. In 2016, I knew dozens of migrants who were devastated when they paid 1,500 to 2,500 euros and failed to reach the other side. This left them trapped in Morocco for many more years, struggling to save up enough money to try again.Amoudou Taibou Diallo, 16.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThis past summer, I noticed a niche market had emerged with some smugglers stepping into the business of transferring money from migrant to smuggler — only after they had safely reached Spanish soil. For a 10 percent increase in fee, migrants can now pay these third parties and secure their investments.Those who find themselves back in Morocco after a boat has capsized or a police vessel has re-routed them, as happens more often than not, have the money to try again.For the smugglers who captained the boat on Feb. 4, a postponed departure would have meant approximately 96,000 euros returned. Another factor: The witness explained how smugglers often call for last-minute departures when bad weather is on the horizon, knowing storms make it easier to evade surveillance efforts by the Guardia Civil.Mamadou Aliou ""Barkley"" Diallo, 34.Credit: Courtesy of the familyWith an overcrowded boat and waves reaching three meters high, they capsized less than an hour into their journey. The passengers were thrown into freezing water without enough life jackets — many of them not knowing how to swim. The oldest reported passenger on board was 34, the youngest had just turned 14. There were at least eight women, one of them pregnant.Lone survivorTwo days after the tragedy, the Royal Navy of Morocco reported that, miraculously, one young man from Mali had been found alive. After a series of interrogations, he was accused of taking part in an illegal operation and is currently being held in police custody.The Nadori police told me they are continuing to search for the top-level smugglers thought to have masterminded this operation and many others like it.Oury Diallo, 18.Credit: Courtesy of the familyPhotographs, names and questions have poured in ever since. Along with them, I received final videos that were recorded by young men like Mamadou Diallo, 21, who tells his mother, “I’ve suffered greatly in my journey to Morocco, but it’s all been worthwhile because, soon, I’ll be calling you from Spain.”And Safourata Sow, 28, who tells her three daughters how much she loves them and misses them.Again and again, I listened to the words of Karim, who was one of the last boys I interviewed in person. Sitting by his makeshift tent he tells me, “We've traveled so far, we've been through so much, I finally understand what my brothers meant when they told me, 'I'll make it to Europe or I'll die trying.' After you've endured the horrors of this journey to Morocco, there's only one way home.”Mamadou Saliou Bah, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the familyGiven the lack of access to basic social services and the active fighting in some communities in West Africa, it is not uncommon to hear of boys like Karim traveling thousands of miles north in search of a way to support their families. Hassane and Houseine Traoré — 28-year-old twin brothers from Cote D’Ivoire — had a similar story to tell.“They were the coolest guys,” says an old friend, Stephanie Dokou, who grew up with them in Cote D’Ivoire. “They were the best athletes our village had ever seen, they played music and sang, they did well in school. All the girls loved them. We knew they would go on to do great things.”Jalloh ""JJ"" Thierno Bah, 26.Credit: Courtesy of the family“They were always together,” explains another old friend, Y’souf Bella. ""One never did anything without the other.”Including their final crossing to Europe. Both boarded the boat, neither body has been found. Their mother calls me every day in hopes I will have some other news. Although Hassane and Houseine were adored in their camp in Morocco, it was difficult for me to track down their actual names for this story, because everyone there knew the charismatic young men simply as “the twins.”The Traoré brothers were not the only twins, though. Alhassane Barry, 26, from Guinea was also on board.Mamadou Saliou Bah, 23.Credit: Courtesy of the family""Hassane was the quiet one. His twin was the outgoing one. Hassane always looked up to his brother, but, in a lot of ways, it was him who the rest of us admired,” said one of his closest friends, Mamadousaliou Diallo, who made it from Morocco to Europe last year.“They lost their father when they were young, and they were both devoted to their mother. She worked so hard to be able to send them to university, and they wanted to provide a better life for her. Hassane studied sociology. He was one of the best students in his class, but when he graduated, there was no work for him. In Guinea, it doesn’t matter how smart you are. If you’re not from a wealthy family, you won’t find a good job. He didn’t tell his brother he was leaving, because he didn’t want him to worry. I was the one who called him to tell him about the tragedy. I wanted him to hear it from a friend before he saw Hassane’s photo on Facebook. He couldn’t breathe. I remember him choking back his tears, saying, how am I going to tell our mother?”Ali Keita, 27.Credit: Courtesy of the family The youngest victimsBut not everyone had a family at home waiting for news of their safe crossing. Youssouf Diallo, 16, and her little brother, 14, who was the youngest reported passenger on board, left their home after losing both of their parents. In the camps, one of the little boy’s friends tells me he cried when he realized there was no one left to notify of their death.Youssouf’s friend, Fatima Diallo, also 16, says, “I made a flower necklace and burned it in the fire last night. Youssouf and I used to make them together.”Some others had family waiting for them on the other side. Tahirou Barry, 24, from Guinea was one of them.""Junior,"" 29.Credit: Courtesy of the familyHis friend, Hady Cissé, tells me, “He had a beautiful woman waiting for him in France! She was the love of his life. They’d known each other since they were little and got married right after university. Tahirou saved up all of his money to help her get a student visa to study abroad after their wedding. They hoped to eventually both finish their studies in Europe, so they could return home and find jobs before having a family of their own. But Tahirou couldn’t wait another two years to see her, so her decided to cross through Morocco. He was counting the days until he would see her again. She didn’t know he had left.”Tidjane Bah, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the familyLike the newlyweds, Marlyatou Diallo, 26, was crossing to meet her husband, who made it to Germany last year and had fallen ill.“Marly wasn’t just my sister — she was the smartest, kindest woman I've ever known,” says Fatima, her older sister, who was watching Marly’s son for her until her return.  Her siblings passed the phone around, each sharing with me their memories of “the little one.”“She’ll be missed by all of us,” her brother, Barry, tells me, “But most of all, she’ll be missed by her husband and son, who she loved with all her heart. How can we explain to him how the world took his mother like this?”Marly’s Facebook page is filled with albums documenting every moment of her son’s life — from his first tooth to his most recent birthday — 5 years old last month.Oumou ""Belle"" Bah, 16.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThe last image she posted was perhaps an answer to her brother’s question — it read, “My son — I carried you for nine months in my body and I’ll carry you always in my heart. If there’s ever a day when I’m not beside you, know that my spirit is still there protecting you.”An incomplete listI have about 47 students in my lecture hall on Wednesday afternoons. Most of them are the same age as those smuggled across the rough waters of the Mediterranean at night. I have thought about how much attention would be devoted to remembering each of their lives if a tragedy of this proportion ever happened.Youssouf Diallo, 18.Credit: Courtesy of the familyFor the past two weeks, I have worked tirelessly collecting names and images, and yet I only have 39. There are still family members who don’t know if their loved ones are gone.Twenty-six lives will never be accounted for in official statistics because no effort was made to recover their bodies from the water. Sixteen of the 21 recovered bodies will soon be dumped in mass graves because no effort was made to identify them in the morgue.The states involved have no incentive to accurately report high death rates, and before reports can be corrected by media sources, a dozen others have occurred.Marlyatou ""Marly"" Diallo, 26.Credit: Courtesy of the familyIn the 24 hours following this tragedy, another boat carrying 39 migrants arrived safely at the Chafarinas Islands off the coast of Morocco, 94 migrants were reported dead in a capsized boat off the coat of Libya, and the Guardia Civil intercepted 31 migrants en route to Melilla. Migration across the Mediterranean is growing by the day.I hope people stop and look at the faces of Marly and Tahirou, Karim and Hassane, “the twins” and the siblings who had no parents to mourn them. I hope they see there were 47 individuals who packed what few belongings they had on their backs, handed their savings over to smugglers, and stepped onto a small wooden fishing boat to begin their lives. They were proud and eager, like students at graduation.Aminatou Diallo, 25.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBut no one was there to see all of the work it had taken for them to get to that final crossing — the thousands of miles journeyed across deserts and in the backs of trucks, the years spent sleeping on forest floors, the untold abuses suffered along the way. They stepped onto a boat carrying dreams of supporting their parents and siblings, partners and children.In all of the years I have spent working in migrant camps across North Africa, I have never met a single individual who wasn't there with the dream of helping someone else left behind. I don't think it's possible to endure the suffering they do unless you have that dream motivating you to reach the other side.Binta ""Bobo"" Baldé, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBefore the waves overthrew the boat, before he fought for one last breath, I imagine Karim was thinking of how long it might take him to save up for a real soccer ball and if the ground in Spain would feel anything like the ground at home.I hope people remember their stories the next time they read headlines about overcrowded boats and numbers, not names, of those lost at sea. The headlines never change, as if the same bodies are washing ashore again and again. But how could it be the same twins who brought music to their hidden camp, the same siblings who clung tightly to one another, the same big-hearted boy with dreams of being a soccer player?Those 47 are gone, soon to be replaced with others, proud and eager.Djenabou Bah, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the family Safourata ""Sofia"" Sow, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyKaissa Camara, 20.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAmadou Bah, 22. Credit: Courtesy of the familyAladji Abdoulaye Diallo, 27.Credit: Courtesy of the familyMamadou Aliou ""Barcley"" Bah, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThierno Bah, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAmadou Bailo Diallo, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the familyMamadou Dian Diallo, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAlpha Oumar Diallo, 19.CCredit: Courtesy of the family40 - 47 Name unknown",35.58318659,-2.795275034,Cabo Tres Forcas,Spain,PRI/PrivateSource/BBC/El Diario/Caminando/IOM/Al-M,http://bit.ly/2DuqHob,1,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,4119,Dorien,08-05-2018,New Entry,24/04/2018,Dorien

There are still family members who don’t know if their loved ones are gone.Twenty-six lives will never be accounted for in official statistics because no effort was made to recover their bodies from the water. Sixteen of the 21 recovered bodies will soon be dumped in mass graves because no effort was made to identify them in the morgue.The states involved have no incentive to accurately report high death rates, and before reports can be corrected by media sources, a dozen others have occurred.Marlyatou ""Marly"" Diallo, 26.Credit: Courtesy of the familyIn the 24 hours following this tragedy, another boat carrying 39 migrants arrived safely at the Chafarinas Islands off the coast of Morocco, 94 migrants were reported dead in a capsized boat off the coat of Libya, and the Guardia Civil intercepted 31 migrants en route to Melilla. Migration across the Mediterranean is growing by the day.I hope people stop and look at the faces of Marly and Tahirou, Karim and Hassane, “the twins” and the siblings who had no parents to mourn them. I hope they see there were 47 individuals who packed what few belongings they had on their backs, handed their savings over to smugglers, and stepped onto a small wooden fishing boat to begin their lives. They were proud and eager, like students at graduation.Aminatou Diallo, 25.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBut no one was there to see all of the work it had taken for them to get to that final crossing — the thousands of miles journeyed across deserts and in the backs of trucks, the years spent sleeping on forest floors, the untold abuses suffered along the way. They stepped onto a boat carrying dreams of supporting their parents and siblings, partners and children.In all of the years I have spent working in migrant camps across North Africa, I have never met a single individual who wasn't there with the dream of helping someone else left behind. I don't think it's possible to endure the suffering they do unless you have that dream motivating you to reach the other side.Binta ""Bobo"" Baldé, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBefore the waves overthrew the boat, before he fought for one last breath, I imagine Karim was thinking of how long it might take him to save up for a real soccer ball and if the ground in Spain would feel anything like the ground at home.I hope people remember their stories the next time they read headlines about overcrowded boats and numbers, not names, of those lost at sea. The headlines never change, as if the same bodies are washing ashore again and again. But how could it be the same twins who brought music to their hidden camp, the same siblings who clung tightly to one another, the same big-hearted boy with dreams of being a soccer player?Those 47 are gone, soon to be replaced with others, proud and eager.Djenabou Bah, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the family Safourata ""Sofia"" Sow, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyKaissa Camara, 20.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAmadou Bah, 22. Credit: Courtesy of the familyAladji Abdoulaye Diallo, 27.Credit: Courtesy of the familyMamadou Aliou ""Barcley"" Bah, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThierno Bah, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAmadou Bailo Diallo, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the familyMamadou Dian Diallo, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAlpha Oumar Diallo, 19.CCredit: Courtesy of the family40 - 47 Name unknown",35.58318659,-2.795275034,Cabo Tres Forcas,Spain,PRI/PrivateSource/BBC/El Diario/Caminando/IOM/Al-M,http://bit.ly/2DuqHob,1,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,4120,Dorien,08-05-2018,New Entry,24/04/2018,Dorien

He was working on a ferry en route to Melilla, one of two Spanish enclaves still remaining in northern Africa. The ferry is part of Trasmediterránea’s large fleet and makes a daily trip between Melilla and Almería, on the Spanish mainland, carrying up to 1,250 passengers on each crossing.Some 4,000 miles away, my cell phone started ringing. I spent most of the following week on the phone with families across West Africa who were desperately searching for any information about their loved ones.Tidiane Jalloh ""TJ""  Bah, 17.Credit: Courtesy of the familyMy son, is he alive? My wife, have they found her body yet? When will we know? How will we know? Is anyone looking for them?For tourists seeking a day-trip to Morocco, there are a host of ferry options from Spain — most take 30 minutes and cost 25 euros per passenger. For African migrants, refugees and asylum seekers seeking the chance at a better life in Europe, there are a host of smuggling options running the same routes in reverse. Most take a full day’s journey at sea and cost an average of 2,000 euros per passenger.Tahirou Barry, 22.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBoarding one of Trasmediterránea’s new ferries, you might notice a small sign warning you of seasickness. Boarding one of the small wooden fishing boats that smugglers captain from Morocco’s coast, migrants don’t need a sign warning them that, as one 15-year-old boy tells me, “You’ll make it to Europe or you’ll die trying.”A difficult processAfter being alerted to bodies floating in the open sea, Maritime Rescue sent a ship from Melilla to begin searching for survivors, and the Guardia Civil launched two smaller rescue missions as well. In the hours that followed, the Royal Navy of Morocco ended up recovering the majority of the bodies, which had drifted to their coastline by the time they responded.Mohammed Diallo, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThe officers placed 20 bodies in one massive, blue plastic bag made for tragedies like this and took them to El Hassani Hospital in Nador. The one body recovered by Spanish police was taken to Melilla. At the morgue, I was told recently, 16 of the 20 bodies remain unidentified.“We have a poster hanging in the police station in Nador with pictures of each face, so the families can identify them,"" an official said.But their families aren’t in Morocco, and the friends of these victims live hidden in forest camps that are routinely under attack by Moroccan police, who threaten to beat, imprison or deport anyone found. The lack of official reporting by Spain and Morocco means family members are left with more questions than answers, often learning about the passing of loved ones from Facebook posts months after an incident has occurred.Abdul Karim Barry, 17.Credit: Courtesy of the familyA short, dangerous crossingMorocco offers the shortest passage to Europe of any African country — less than eight miles across the Mediterranean Sea — and the Spanish enclaves of Melilla and Ceuta make it the only country on the African continent to share a land border with the internally borderless EU.It is one of the most trafficked border regions in the world right now, with the number of people attempting to escape violence and poverty across West and Central Africa growing daily. The closing of other primary routes to Europe in Libya, where migrants are now being bought and sold in an emergent slave trade, is pushing more people to Morocco’s borders.Houseine Traoré, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBut the steady reinforcement of the Spain-Morocco land border, which is now secured by three rings of 20-foot high razor-wire fences and under constant surveillance by the Guardia Civil, means even more are attempting treacherous sea crossings.According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the number of migrants reaching Spain by way of the Mediterranean tripled to nearly 22,000 last year, and the number of reported drownings off the Spanish coast doubled. However, the 223 drownings reported in 2017 only account for bodies that were recovered and identified.Hassane Traoré, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyLess than two months into 2018, there have already been 75 victims recovered, including the 21 found floating off the coast of Melilla last month.

I didn’t want to simply break the news that it was 47 migrants and two smugglers, not 21 people, who were lost at sea. I wanted to report who had been lost. I enlisted the migrants still living in Morocco’s hidden camps to help me collect names, faces and stories. They knew better than anyone the group who left just after nightfall on Feb. 3 to walk 16 miles to the meeting point their smugglers had given them.An anthropologist by training, I started working on issues of migration and international human rights a decade ago and have spent many years living in the hundreds of makeshift camps around primary departure points in Morocco, Algeria and Libya.

He was working on a ferry en route to Melilla, one of two Spanish enclaves still remaining in northern Africa. The ferry is part of Trasmediterránea’s large fleet and makes a daily trip between Melilla and Almería, on the Spanish mainland, carrying up to 1,250 passengers on each crossing.Some 4,000 miles away, my cell phone started ringing.

My wife, have they found her body yet? When will we know? How will we know?

For African migrants, refugees and asylum seekers seeking the chance at a better life in Europe, there are a host of smuggling options running the same routes in reverse. Most take a full day’s journey at sea and cost an average of 2,000 euros per passenger.Tahirou Barry, 22.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBoarding one of Trasmediterránea’s new ferries, you might notice a small sign warning you of seasickness. Boarding one of the small wooden fishing boats that smugglers captain from Morocco’s coast, migrants don’t need a sign warning them that, as one 15-year-old boy tells me, “You’ll make it to Europe or you’ll die trying.”A difficult processAfter being alerted to bodies floating in the open sea, Maritime Rescue sent a ship from Melilla to begin searching for survivors, and the Guardia Civil launched two smaller rescue missions as well. In the hours that followed, the Royal Navy of Morocco ended up recovering the majority of the bodies, which had drifted to their coastline by the time they responded.Mohammed Diallo, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThe officers placed 20 bodies in one massive, blue plastic bag made for tragedies like this and took them to El Hassani Hospital in Nador. The one body recovered by Spanish police was taken to Melilla.

The lack of official reporting by Spain and Morocco means family members are left with more questions than answers, often learning about the passing of loved ones from Facebook posts months after an incident has occurred.Abdul Karim Barry, 17.Credit: Courtesy of the familyA short, dangerous crossingMorocco offers the shortest passage to Europe of any African country — less than eight miles across the Mediterranean Sea — and the Spanish enclaves of Melilla and Ceuta make it the only country on the African continent to share a land border with the internally borderless EU.It is one of the most trafficked border regions in the world right now, with the number of people attempting to escape violence and poverty across West and Central Africa growing daily. The closing of other primary routes to Europe in Libya, where migrants are now being bought and sold in an emergent slave trade, is pushing more people to Morocco’s borders.Houseine Traoré, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBut the steady reinforcement of the Spain-Morocco land border, which is now secured by three rings of 20-foot high razor-wire fences and under constant surveillance by the Guardia Civil, means even more are attempting treacherous sea crossings.According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the number of migrants reaching Spain by way of the Mediterranean tripled to nearly 22,000 last year, and the number of reported drownings off the Spanish coast doubled. However, the 223 drownings reported in 2017 only account for bodies that were recovered and identified.Hassane Traoré, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyLess than two months into 2018, there have already been 75 victims recovered, including the 21 found floating off the coast of Melilla last month.

All African migrants. All packed into a small wooden fishing boat that capsized off the coast of Morocco’s Spanish enclave.There was no follow-up as the victim count edged upward, ultimately winding up more than double what was originally reported.As I followed the coverage by various sources, I noticed there was never a single name released.Who are all of these people, assigned numbers, not names, in the morgue? Where were they coming from, what had driven them to their final crossing, and what had they expected to find on the other side?Alhassane Barry, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyI needed more than a number. I didn’t want to simply break the news that it was 47 migrants and two smugglers, not 21 people, who were lost at sea. I wanted to report who had been lost. I enlisted the migrants still living in Morocco’s hidden camps to help me collect names, faces and stories. They knew better than anyone the group who left just after nightfall on Feb. 3 to walk 16 miles to the meeting point their smugglers had given them.An anthropologist by training, I started working on issues of migration and international human rights a decade ago and have spent many years living in the hundreds of makeshift camps around primary departure points in Morocco, Algeria and Libya. The first time I gained access to Carrière — one of Morocco’s largest and most tightly controlled camps — was when I was working on another story for PRI in the summer of 2016.Amoudoubailo Diallo, 20.Credit: Courtesy of the familyIt was a complicated process requiring permitting at the governmental level and clearance at the local level — from the smuggling rings that control the space and the brotherhoods of migrants themselves.I spent the following year in the region finishing a documentary film that captures the journeys of three migrants from Guinea, Mali and the DRC to their final attempted crossings. I was back in Carrière as recently as last month. In fact, I had only been back in the US for a week when I received my first phone call alerting me to the capsized boat carrying people I knew well.Bouboucar Bah, 32.Credit: Courtesy of the family'Smart, brave, generous'The photograph of Abdul Karim Barry — a 17-year-old boy from Guinea — was one of the first I saw.Karim had been in Carrière awaiting his chance at crossing for over two years. He left his home at the age of 15 and traveled more than 3,000 miles alone — from Guinea to Morocco. After his father died, he felt responsible for taking care of his younger brothers and sisters when his mother couldn’t find any way to support the family in their rural community. He wanted to give his siblings the chance to go to school like his father had given him.Ben Ali Bah, 24.Credit: Courtesy of the family“Karim was smart and brave and above all, he was generous,” one of his closest friends, Mamadou Bah, tells me over a crackling phone line. “He always struggled for the well-being of the group, even risking the dangers of going into the street to beg for us when we couldn't find enough food to eat. It was Karim who prepared the one daily meal for our brotherhood every night.”I posted a photograph of him and asked his friends in Morocco and Guinea to help me make him more than a number.“Karim studied hard before leaving home,” Thierno Jalloh wrote, “and he used his education to speak up for the other boys who didn't have any. He was young, but he was a natural leader with a big heart. He couldn’t stand for anyone to be treated as less than human because of the color of their skin.”Alpha ""Bambino"" Bah, 14.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAbdoulaye Barry wrote, “He told me he dreamed of becoming a soccer player when he was little. He played on a team in Guinea, and he was really good. But as you grow older, you realize some of your dreams won’t ever be realized. Still, Karim played with me in the forest sometimes. We had a ball we made out of plastic and tape.”Rough conditionsIn the hours before the first bodies were spotted, Karim, along with 46 men, women, and children coming from Guinea, Cote D’Ivoire, Cameroon, Senegal and Mali left their camp in Carrière. Their smugglers, two Moroccan men, were waiting for them on a rocky beach in Arekmane.Mamadou Billo Diallo, 25.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThey carried a small wooden fishing boat that had been rigged with an outboard motor down to the water. A witness who traveled with the migrants but didn’t board the boat that night said the winds were too strong for a safe crossing — 50 mph, according to official reports.So why would smugglers choose to travel, risking their own lives, under such rough conditions?In previous years, they wouldn’t have. But new systems created to protect migrants’ financial investments have made tragedies like this one significantly more likely. In 2016, I knew dozens of migrants who were devastated when they paid 1,500 to 2,500 euros and failed to reach the other side. This left them trapped in Morocco for many more years, struggling to save up enough money to try again.Amoudou Taibou Diallo, 16.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThis past summer, I noticed a niche market had emerged with some smugglers stepping into the business of transferring money from migrant to smuggler — only after they had safely reached Spanish soil. For a 10 percent increase in fee, migrants can now pay these third parties and secure their investments.Those who find themselves back in Morocco after a boat has capsized or a police vessel has re-routed them, as happens more often than not, have the money to try again.For the smugglers who captained the boat on Feb. 4, a postponed departure would have meant approximately 96,000 euros returned. Another factor: The witness explained how smugglers often call for last-minute departures when bad weather is on the horizon, knowing storms make it easier to evade surveillance efforts by the Guardia Civil.Mamadou Aliou ""Barkley"" Diallo, 34.Credit: Courtesy of the familyWith an overcrowded boat and waves reaching three meters high, they capsized less than an hour into their journey. The passengers were thrown into freezing water without enough life jackets — many of them not knowing how to swim. The oldest reported passenger on board was 34, the youngest had just turned 14. There were at least eight women, one of them pregnant.Lone survivorTwo days after the tragedy, the Royal Navy of Morocco reported that, miraculously, one young man from Mali had been found alive. After a series of interrogations, he was accused of taking part in an illegal operation and is currently being held in police custody.The Nadori police told me they are continuing to search for the top-level smugglers thought to have masterminded this operation and many others like it.Oury Diallo, 18.Credit: Courtesy of the familyPhotographs, names and questions have poured in ever since. Along with them, I received final videos that were recorded by young men like Mamadou Diallo, 21, who tells his mother, “I’ve suffered greatly in my journey to Morocco, but it’s all been worthwhile because, soon, I’ll be calling you from Spain.”And Safourata Sow, 28, who tells her three daughters how much she loves them and misses them.Again and again, I listened to the words of Karim, who was one of the last boys I interviewed in person. Sitting by his makeshift tent he tells me, “We've traveled so far, we've been through so much, I finally understand what my brothers meant when they told me, 'I'll make it to Europe or I'll die trying.' After you've endured the horrors of this journey to Morocco, there's only one way home.”Mamadou Saliou Bah, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the familyGiven the lack of access to basic social services and the active fighting in some communities in West Africa, it is not uncommon to hear of boys like Karim traveling thousands of miles north in search of a way to support their families. Hassane and Houseine Traoré — 28-year-old twin brothers from Cote D’Ivoire — had a similar story to tell.“They were the coolest guys,” says an old friend, Stephanie Dokou, who grew up with them in Cote D’Ivoire. “They were the best athletes our village had ever seen, they played music and sang, they did well in school. All the girls loved them. We knew they would go on to do great things.”Jalloh ""JJ"" Thierno Bah, 26.Credit: Courtesy of the family“They were always together,” explains another old friend, Y’souf Bella. ""One never did anything without the other.”Including their final crossing to Europe. Both boarded the boat, neither body has been found. Their mother calls me every day in hopes I will have some other news. Although Hassane and Houseine were adored in their camp in Morocco, it was difficult for me to track down their actual names for this story, because everyone there knew the charismatic young men simply as “the twins.”The Traoré brothers were not the only twins, though. Alhassane Barry, 26, from Guinea was also on board.Mamadou Saliou Bah, 23.Credit: Courtesy of the family""Hassane was the quiet one. His twin was the outgoing one. Hassane always looked up to his brother, but, in a lot of ways, it was him who the rest of us admired,” said one of his closest friends, Mamadousaliou Diallo, who made it from Morocco to Europe last year.“They lost their father when they were young, and they were both devoted to their mother. She worked so hard to be able to send them to university, and they wanted to provide a better life for her. Hassane studied sociology. He was one of the best students in his class, but when he graduated, there was no work for him. In Guinea, it doesn’t matter how smart you are. If you’re not from a wealthy family, you won’t find a good job. He didn’t tell his brother he was leaving, because he didn’t want him to worry. I was the one who called him to tell him about the tragedy. I wanted him to hear it from a friend before he saw Hassane’s photo on Facebook. He couldn’t breathe. I remember him choking back his tears, saying, how am I going to tell our mother?”Ali Keita, 27.Credit: Courtesy of the family The youngest victimsBut not everyone had a family at home waiting for news of their safe crossing. Youssouf Diallo, 16, and her little brother, 14, who was the youngest reported passenger on board, left their home after losing both of their parents. In the camps, one of the little boy’s friends tells me he cried when he realized there was no one left to notify of their death.Youssouf’s friend, Fatima Diallo, also 16, says, “I made a flower necklace and burned it in the fire last night. Youssouf and I used to make them together.”Some others had family waiting for them on the other side. Tahirou Barry, 24, from Guinea was one of them.""Junior,"" 29.Credit: Courtesy of the familyHis friend, Hady Cissé, tells me, “He had a beautiful woman waiting for him in France! She was the love of his life. They’d known each other since they were little and got married right after university. Tahirou saved up all of his money to help her get a student visa to study abroad after their wedding. They hoped to eventually both finish their studies in Europe, so they could return home and find jobs before having a family of their own. But Tahirou couldn’t wait another two years to see her, so her decided to cross through Morocco. He was counting the days until he would see her again. She didn’t know he had left.”Tidjane Bah, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the familyLike the newlyweds, Marlyatou Diallo, 26, was crossing to meet her husband, who made it to Germany last year and had fallen ill.“Marly wasn’t just my sister — she was the smartest, kindest woman I've ever known,” says Fatima, her older sister, who was watching Marly’s son for her until her return.  Her siblings passed the phone around, each sharing with me their memories of “the little one.”“She’ll be missed by all of us,” her brother, Barry, tells me, “But most of all, she’ll be missed by her husband and son, who she loved with all her heart. How can we explain to him how the world took his mother like this?”Marly’s Facebook page is filled with albums documenting every moment of her son’s life — from his first tooth to his most recent birthday — 5 years old last month.Oumou ""Belle"" Bah, 16.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThe last image she posted was perhaps an answer to her brother’s question — it read, “My son — I carried you for nine months in my body and I’ll carry you always in my heart. If there’s ever a day when I’m not beside you, know that my spirit is still there protecting you.”An incomplete listI have about 47 students in my lecture hall on Wednesday afternoons.

They hoped to eventually both finish their studies in Europe, so they could return home and find jobs before having a family of their own. But Tahirou couldn’t wait another two years to see her, so her decided to cross through Morocco. He was counting the days until he would see her again. She didn’t know he had left.”Tidjane Bah, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the familyLike the newlyweds, Marlyatou Diallo, 26, was crossing to meet her husband, who made it to Germany last year and had fallen ill.“Marly wasn’t just my sister — she was the smartest, kindest woman I've ever known,” says Fatima, her older sister, who was watching Marly’s son for her until her return.  Her siblings passed the phone around, each sharing with me their memories of “the little one.”“She’ll be missed by all of us,” her brother, Barry, tells me, “But most of all, she’ll be missed by her husband and son, who she loved with all her heart. How can we explain to him how the world took his mother like this?”Marly’s Facebook page is filled with albums documenting every moment of her son’s life — from his first tooth to his most recent birthday — 5 years old last month.Oumou ""Belle"" Bah, 16.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThe last image she posted was perhaps an answer to her brother’s question — it read, “My son — I carried you for nine months in my body and I’ll carry you always in my heart. If there’s ever a day when I’m not beside you, know that my spirit is still there protecting you.”An incomplete listI have about 47 students in my lecture hall on Wednesday afternoons. Most of them are the same age as those smuggled across the rough waters of the Mediterranean at night. I have thought about how much attention would be devoted to remembering each of their lives if a tragedy of this proportion ever happened.Youssouf Diallo, 18.Credit: Courtesy of the familyFor the past two weeks, I have worked tirelessly collecting names and images, and yet I only have 39. There are still family members who don’t know if their loved ones are gone.Twenty-six lives will never be accounted for in official statistics because no effort was made to recover their bodies from the water. Sixteen of the 21 recovered bodies will soon be dumped in mass graves because no effort was made to identify them in the morgue.The states involved have no incentive to accurately report high death rates, and before reports can be corrected by media sources, a dozen others have occurred.Marlyatou ""Marly"" Diallo, 26.Credit: Courtesy of the familyIn the 24 hours following this tragedy, another boat carrying 39 migrants arrived safely at the Chafarinas Islands off the coast of Morocco, 94 migrants were reported dead in a capsized boat off the coat of Libya, and the Guardia Civil intercepted 31 migrants en route to Melilla. Migration across the Mediterranean is growing by the day.I hope people stop and look at the faces of Marly and Tahirou, Karim and Hassane, “the twins” and the siblings who had no parents to mourn them. I hope they see there were 47 individuals who packed what few belongings they had on their backs, handed their savings over to smugglers, and stepped onto a small wooden fishing boat to begin their lives. They were proud and eager, like students at graduation.Aminatou Diallo, 25.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBut no one was there to see all of the work it had taken for them to get to that final crossing — the thousands of miles journeyed across deserts and in the backs of trucks, the years spent sleeping on forest floors, the untold abuses suffered along the way. They stepped onto a boat carrying dreams of supporting their parents and siblings, partners and children.In all of the years I have spent working in migrant camps across North Africa, I have never met a single individual who wasn't there with the dream of helping someone else left behind. I don't think it's possible to endure the suffering they do unless you have that dream motivating you to reach the other side.Binta ""Bobo"" Baldé, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBefore the waves overthrew the boat, before he fought for one last breath, I imagine Karim was thinking of how long it might take him to save up for a real soccer ball and if the ground in Spain would feel anything like the ground at home.I hope people remember their stories the next time they read headlines about overcrowded boats and numbers, not names, of those lost at sea. The headlines never change, as if the same bodies are washing ashore again and again. But how could it be the same twins who brought music to their hidden camp, the same siblings who clung tightly to one another, the same big-hearted boy with dreams of being a soccer player?Those 47 are gone, soon to be replaced with others, proud and eager.Djenabou Bah, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the family Safourata ""Sofia"" Sow, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyKaissa Camara, 20.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAmadou Bah, 22. Credit: Courtesy of the familyAladji Abdoulaye Diallo, 27.Credit: Courtesy of the familyMamadou Aliou ""Barcley"" Bah, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThierno Bah, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAmadou Bailo Diallo, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the familyMamadou Dian Diallo, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAlpha Oumar Diallo, 19.CCredit: Courtesy of the family40 - 47 Name unknown",35.58318659,-2.795275034,Cabo Tres Forcas,Spain,PRI/PrivateSource/BBC/El Diario/Caminando/IOM/Al-M,http://bit.ly/2DuqHob,1,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,4123,Dorien,08-05-2018,New Entry,24/04/2018,Dorien

He was working on a ferry en route to Melilla, one of two Spanish enclaves still remaining in northern Africa. The ferry is part of Trasmediterránea’s large fleet and makes a daily trip between Melilla and Almería, on the Spanish mainland, carrying up to 1,250 passengers on each crossing.Some 4,000 miles away, my cell phone started ringing.

My wife, have they found her body yet? When will we know? How will we know? Is anyone looking for them?For tourists seeking a day-trip to Morocco, there are a host of ferry options from Spain — most take 30 minutes and cost 25 euros per passenger. For African migrants, refugees and asylum seekers seeking the chance at a better life in Europe, there are a host of smuggling options running the same routes in reverse. Most take a full day’s journey at sea and cost an average of 2,000 euros per passenger.Tahirou Barry, 22.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBoarding one of Trasmediterránea’s new ferries, you might notice a small sign warning you of seasickness. Boarding one of the small wooden fishing boats that smugglers captain from Morocco’s coast, migrants don’t need a sign warning them that, as one 15-year-old boy tells me, “You’ll make it to Europe or you’ll die trying.”A difficult processAfter being alerted to bodies floating in the open sea, Maritime Rescue sent a ship from Melilla to begin searching for survivors, and the Guardia Civil launched two smaller rescue missions as well. In the hours that followed, the Royal Navy of Morocco ended up recovering the majority of the bodies, which had drifted to their coastline by the time they responded.Mohammed Diallo, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThe officers placed 20 bodies in one massive, blue plastic bag made for tragedies like this and took them to El Hassani Hospital in Nador. The one body recovered by Spanish police was taken to Melilla. At the morgue, I was told recently, 16 of the 20 bodies remain unidentified.“We have a poster hanging in the police station in Nador with pictures of each face, so the families can identify them,"" an official said.But their families aren’t in Morocco, and the friends of these victims live hidden in forest camps that are routinely under attack by Moroccan police, who threaten to beat, imprison or deport anyone found. The lack of official reporting by Spain and Morocco means family members are left with more questions than answers, often learning about the passing of loved ones from Facebook posts months after an incident has occurred.Abdul Karim Barry, 17.Credit: Courtesy of the familyA short, dangerous crossingMorocco offers the shortest passage to Europe of any African country — less than eight miles across the Mediterranean Sea — and the Spanish enclaves of Melilla and Ceuta make it the only country on the African continent to share a land border with the internally borderless EU.It is one of the most trafficked border regions in the world right now, with the number of people attempting to escape violence and poverty across West and Central Africa growing daily. The closing of other primary routes to Europe in Libya, where migrants are now being bought and sold in an emergent slave trade, is pushing more people to Morocco’s borders.Houseine Traoré, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBut the steady reinforcement of the Spain-Morocco land border, which is now secured by three rings of 20-foot high razor-wire fences and under constant surveillance by the Guardia Civil, means even more are attempting treacherous sea crossings.According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the number of migrants reaching Spain by way of the Mediterranean tripled to nearly 22,000 last year, and the number of reported drownings off the Spanish coast doubled. However, the 223 drownings reported in 2017 only account for bodies that were recovered and identified.Hassane Traoré, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyLess than two months into 2018, there have already been 75 victims recovered, including the 21 found floating off the coast of Melilla last month.

She was the love of his life. They’d known each other since they were little and got married right after university. Tahirou saved up all of his money to help her get a student visa to study abroad after their wedding. They hoped to eventually both finish their studies in Europe, so they could return home and find jobs before having a family of their own. But Tahirou couldn’t wait another two years to see her, so her decided to cross through Morocco. He was counting the days until he would see her again. She didn’t know he had left.”Tidjane Bah, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the familyLike the newlyweds, Marlyatou Diallo, 26, was crossing to meet her husband, who made it to Germany last year and had fallen ill.“Marly wasn’t just my sister — she was the smartest, kindest woman I've ever known,” says Fatima, her older sister, who was watching Marly’s son for her until her return.  Her siblings passed the phone around, each sharing with me their memories of “the little one.”“She’ll be missed by all of us,” her brother, Barry, tells me, “But most of all, she’ll be missed by her husband and son, who she loved with all her heart. How can we explain to him how the world took his mother like this?”Marly’s Facebook page is filled with albums documenting every moment of her son’s life — from his first tooth to his most recent birthday — 5 years old last month.Oumou ""Belle"" Bah, 16.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThe last image she posted was perhaps an answer to her brother’s question — it read, “My son — I carried you for nine months in my body and I’ll carry you always in my heart. If there’s ever a day when I’m not beside you, know that my spirit is still there protecting you.”An incomplete listI have about 47 students in my lecture hall on Wednesday afternoons. Most of them are the same age as those smuggled across the rough waters of the Mediterranean at night. I have thought about how much attention would be devoted to remembering each of their lives if a tragedy of this proportion ever happened.Youssouf Diallo, 18.Credit: Courtesy of the familyFor the past two weeks, I have worked tirelessly collecting names and images, and yet I only have 39. There are still family members who don’t know if their loved ones are gone.Twenty-six lives will never be accounted for in official statistics because no effort was made to recover their bodies from the water. Sixteen of the 21 recovered bodies will soon be dumped in mass graves because no effort was made to identify them in the morgue.The states involved have no incentive to accurately report high death rates, and before reports can be corrected by media sources, a dozen others have occurred.Marlyatou ""Marly"" Diallo, 26.Credit: Courtesy of the familyIn the 24 hours following this tragedy, another boat carrying 39 migrants arrived safely at the Chafarinas Islands off the coast of Morocco, 94 migrants were reported dead in a capsized boat off the coat of Libya, and the Guardia Civil intercepted 31 migrants en route to Melilla. Migration across the Mediterranean is growing by the day.I hope people stop and look at the faces of Marly and Tahirou, Karim and Hassane, “the twins” and the siblings who had no parents to mourn them. I hope they see there were 47 individuals who packed what few belongings they had on their backs, handed their savings over to smugglers, and stepped onto a small wooden fishing boat to begin their lives. They were proud and eager, like students at graduation.Aminatou Diallo, 25.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBut no one was there to see all of the work it had taken for them to get to that final crossing — the thousands of miles journeyed across deserts and in the backs of trucks, the years spent sleeping on forest floors, the untold abuses suffered along the way. They stepped onto a boat carrying dreams of supporting their parents and siblings, partners and children.In all of the years I have spent working in migrant camps across North Africa, I have never met a single individual who wasn't there with the dream of helping someone else left behind. I don't think it's possible to endure the suffering they do unless you have that dream motivating you to reach the other side.Binta ""Bobo"" Baldé, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyBefore the waves overthrew the boat, before he fought for one last breath, I imagine Karim was thinking of how long it might take him to save up for a real soccer ball and if the ground in Spain would feel anything like the ground at home.I hope people remember their stories the next time they read headlines about overcrowded boats and numbers, not names, of those lost at sea. The headlines never change, as if the same bodies are washing ashore again and again. But how could it be the same twins who brought music to their hidden camp, the same siblings who clung tightly to one another, the same big-hearted boy with dreams of being a soccer player?Those 47 are gone, soon to be replaced with others, proud and eager.Djenabou Bah, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the family Safourata ""Sofia"" Sow, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyKaissa Camara, 20.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAmadou Bah, 22. Credit: Courtesy of the familyAladji Abdoulaye Diallo, 27.Credit: Courtesy of the familyMamadou Aliou ""Barcley"" Bah, 28.Credit: Courtesy of the familyThierno Bah, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAmadou Bailo Diallo, 19.Credit: Courtesy of the familyMamadou Dian Diallo, 21.Credit: Courtesy of the familyAlpha Oumar Diallo, 19.CCredit: Courtesy of the family40 - 47 Name unknown",35.58318659,-2.795275034,Cabo Tres Forcas,Spain,PRI/PrivateSource/BBC/El Diario/Caminando/IOM/Al-M,http://bit.ly/2DuqHob,1,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,4124,Dorien,08-05-2018,New Entry,24/04/2018,Dorien

Two other women were badly hurt and dozens of others received treatment for less serious injuries, La Repubblica reported.According to the newspaper, Moses had only been staying in the encampment for a few days before her death. She was previously a resident in Riace, a small town on the other side of Reggio Calabria province that has rehoused refugees from all over the world as part of a widely praised resettlement programme.However, having recently had her application for political asylum denied, Moses was obliged to leave Riace and had been sleeping instead in a tent in San Ferdinando.The encampment, on the outskirts of San Ferdinando in an area called Rosarno, is home to around 1,000 people living in tents and shacks. Most of the residents work as labourers on local farms.The shantytown sprang up after violence broke out between locals, migrants and police in 2010, leaving more than 50 people injured and prompting hundreds of foreign workers to flee the centre of town. Tensions have remained high in Rosarno ever since.According to the Italian aid group Doctors for Human Rights (Medu), as many as 3,000 labourers – the majority of them with valid residence permits for Italy – live in the camp at the height of the harvest, working for minimal wages and sleeping without electricity or running water in conditions that the NGO describes as “shamefully inhumane”. It calls the tent city “one of the biggest ghettoes in Italy”.The cause of the fire last weekend is unclear, though smaller blazes in the past have resulted from residents lighting bonfires for warmth.As a result of Monday's march, USB said, regional authorities have agreed to allow people living in the camp to register as local residents. Anyone whose documents were destroyed in the blaze will also be given an official certificate of loss to help them obtain replacements, the union said.

(23, man)",Afghanistan,"suicide, jumped in front of train in Maintal-Dörnigheim (D) in fear of deportation ","25.01.2018 07:06 UhrTrauer um jungen Flüchtling in MaintalEinem Flüchtling in Maintal (Main-Kinzig-Kreis) drohte die Abschiebung nach Afghanistan. Der 23-Jährige soll sich möglicherweise deshalb vor einen Zug geworfen haben. Die Polizei ermittelt.Trauer und Fassungslosigkeit herrschen im Arbeitskreis Asyl nach dem Tod eines jungen Geflüchteten in Maintal: „Wir sind sehr traurig, dass H. keinen anderen Weg mehr gesehen hat. Möge er bei Gott einen besseren und friedlichen Platz finden. In Afghanistan hatte er ihn nicht, und hier bei uns in Deutschland hatte er scheinbar keine Hoffnung mehr.“ Mit diesen Worten gedenken die Ehrenamtlichen des 23-Jährigen. Jetzt möchten sie helfen, ihn zurück nach Afghanistan zu bringen, wo ein Teil seiner Familie lebt, und sammeln Spenden für die Überführung.Der offenbar alleinstehende Afghane, der in einer städtischen Sammelunterkunft lebte, starb am Freitag. Er soll sich im Maintaler Stadtteil Dörnigheim vor einen Zug geworfen haben, so der Verdacht. Oberstaatsanwalt Dominik Mies bestätigt auf FR-Anfrage, dass ein Todesermittlungsverfahren eingeleitet worden ist. Einiges deute auf einen Suizid hin, die Ermittlungen seien allerdings noch nicht abgeschlossen, sagte Mies am Mittwoch.Der Tod ist für viele Freunde und Bekannte H.s ein Schock. Warum? Und warum gerade jetzt? Diese Fragen gehen ihnen nicht aus dem Kopf. Was die ausschlaggebenden Gründe waren, kann niemand sagen. Eine Reihe von Faktoren dürfte eine Rolle gespielt haben – darunter die drohende Abschiebung. Nachdem sein Asylantrag abgelehnt worden war, hatte H. Angst. Der nächste Termin vor dem Verwaltungsgericht stand bevor. An einen guten Ausgang glaubte der Schutzsuchende womöglich nicht mehr.Still, nachdenklich, sympathisch sei H. gewesen, erinnert sich Christine Mayer-Simon vom Arbeitskreis Asyl. Er habe die wenigen Integrationsangebote, die Afghanen offenstünden, intensiv genutzt. Habe versucht, so gut Deutsch zu lernen wie möglich, und einen Job gefunden. Dort soll es zuletzt Probleme gegeben haben.In der Sammelunterkunft hat H. – ein sportlicher junger Mann, der den FC Barcelona und die afghanische Sängerin Mozhdah Jamalzadah mochte – sich mit Freunden ein Zimmer geteilt. Sie seien dort gut miteinander zurechtgekommen, heißt es. Den Mitbewohnern war aufgefallen, dass der 23-Jährige in der Woche vor seinem Tod ruhiger und trauriger war. Sie hätten ihn wiederholt darauf angesprochen und probiert, an ihn heranzukommen.Von eindeutigen Warnhinweisen ist jedoch nicht die Rede. Er habe angekündigt, demnächst wieder an der Beratung für Geflüchtete teilzunehmen. Und unmittelbar vor seinem Tod war H. bei einem Discounter einkaufen. Nachdem er zurückgekehrt war, sagte H., er müsse noch mal weg, und kam nicht wieder.„Wir sind alle erschüttert über den Tod dieses jungen Menschen, der sich sehr um seine Integration bemüht hat“, sagt Maintals Erster Stadtrat und Sozialdezernent Ralf Sachtleber (parteilos). Das Verhältnis zwischen ihm und den städtischen Mitarbeitern sei gut gewesen. Diese kümmerten sich jetzt zusammen mit Geistlichen um die trauernden Freunde und Bekannten. Es sei wichtig, sie aufzufangen.In den vergangenen Jahren hatten im Main-Kinzig-Kreis schon mehrere Flüchtlinge versucht, sich das Leben zu nehmen, berichten ehrenamtliche Helfer. Aktivisten wie Marion Bayer kritisieren die enorme psychische Belastung, der viele Asylsuchende ausgesetzt seien. Der Druck sei hoch, besonders wegen der Gefahr, abgeschoben zu werden, aber auch wegen der riesigen Hindernisse beim Familiennachzug oder der Missstände in einem Teil der Unterkünfte.Für die oft traumatisierten Geflüchteten sei es sehr schwer, eine Therapie zu bekommen, bemängelt die Landtagsabgeordnete Gabi Faulhaber (Linke), wegen Hürden beim Zugang und eines Mangels an Therapeuten. Trotz vieler Suizidversuche werde das Problem nach wie vor nicht richtig ernst genommen, so Faulhaber. Und Afghanen litten noch stärker unter Perspektivlosigkeit als andere, vor allem aufgrund der „Drohkulisse, in ein alles andere als sicheres Herkunftsland abgeschoben zu werden“ und des mangelnden Zugangs etwa zu Sprachkursen.",50.142616,8.840889,Maintal,Germany,FR,http://www.fr.de/rhein-main/alle-gemeinden/main-kinzig-kreis/fluechtlinge-in-hessen-trauer-um-jungen-fluechtling-in-maintal-a-1433874,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4009,Dorien,17-04-2018,New entry,17/04/2018,Dorien

A girl survived after clinging to the body of her mother, witnesses said.“We saved 86 migrants,” Maria Rita Agliozzo, an Order of Malta doctor on the Italian coastguard vessel, told Radio Radicale. “We did many resuscitations. We resuscitated two children – a two-year-old and a three-year-old – and also a woman.”Rescuers pulled dozens of people to safety, some of whom had managed to stay onboard the half-submerged dinghy. The bodies of eight women were recovered.The deaths represent the first large-scale migrant tragedy of 2018 in the Mediterranean. A total of 2,832 migrants died on the central Mediterranean route between Libya and Italy in 2017, down from 4,581 in 2016. The number of migrants who reached Italy in 2017 was 119,310, down from 181,436 in 2016.Flavio Di Giacomo, of the IOM, said survivors interviewed in Catania after their rescue reported that 150 people had been onboard the dinghy when it set off from the Libyan coast.“Sixty-four migrants lost their life in the shipwreck [which] occurred last Saturday,” Di Giacomo said.Médicines Sans Frontières (MSF) tweeted: “Survivors held on to the wreckage as they waited for a rescue with the bodies of those who didn’t make it, including family members, floating around them. It’s 2018 and people continue to die in the ‪Mediterranean.”The IOM and UNHCR said the migrants came from the Gambia, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Mali, Ivory Coast, Senegal, Cameroon and Nigeria.The dinghy had been spotted by an aircraft from a European naval mission targeting people trafficking.Local police kept journalists away from the landing area for survivors of Saturday’s disaster. The mayor of Catania, Enzo Bianco, said anyone who played on such tragedies for political gain would have to look to their consciences.Bianco told Radio Radicale that a child whose mother died was among the survivors of the weekend’s disaster. “I watched a three-year-old girl while she was starting to play at the port here. She was saved, grabbed at the last second, by the coastguard in the sea,” he said. “She was clinging to her mother and she saw her drown.” Bianco said the girl was now with her aunt, who also survived the wreck.Hundreds of thousands of people have been rescued and taken to southern Italian ports in the past few years, including nearly 119,000 in 2017. More than 3,000 drowned in the Mediterranean last year, the IOM said.They included refugees fleeing wars or persecution who hoped to be given asylum, and economic migrants mainly from sub-Saharan Africa.There was a sharp drop in arrivals in Italy during the second half of 2017 following efforts by Rome to discourage migrants from attempting the crossing.The treatment of migrants in Italy is likely to become even more controversial in the run-up to parliamentary elections in March. Many Italians feel the country has been forced to carry an unfair burden, but many object to its increasingly harsh approach.Separately, the Libyan coastguard announced it had rescued 270 people from two boats in distress in a stretch of sea east of Tripoli.--ROME (AP) — At least eight migrants died and 86 others were rescued Saturday from a smugglers' rubber dinghy after it starting sinking in the Mediterranean Sea off Libya, the Italian coast guard said. A search was ongoing to find any more possible survivors.An aid group not involved in the rescue said dozens of migrants could still be missing. The coast guard said there was no confirmation of Libyan authorities' statement that at least 25 migrants had died.The Italian coast guard, which coordinates rescues in international waters off Libya's coast, said an aircraft on patrol for a European anti-smuggling operation had spotted the dinghy, which was in difficulty Saturday morning. Italian navy and coast guard vessels were involved in the rescue.Coast guard Cmdr. Sergio Liardo told Italian state TV RaiNews24 that ""it appears the dinghy deflated"" after a puncture. When rescuers arrived in the early afternoon, some 20 migrants were still in the dinghy while others were in the water.All eight victims were female, Liardo said.Asked about the Libyan navy's account that at least 25 migrants had perished, Liardo said ""that's not confirmed."" He said survivors told rescuers that roughly 150 migrants were aboard when the dinghy was launched from Libya's coast.""We are looking for any eventual survivors,"" Liardo said, adding the search would continue through the night.Authorities say the actual death toll in many of the migrant boats that sink in the Mediterranean is never known, and that some boats vanish without a trace. The smugglers routinely crowd much more than 100 people into motorized rubber dinghies designed to hold far fewer, aiming to maximize profits on the route from lawless Libya toward southern Europe.--IOM:Survivors arriving in the port of Catania, Siciliy, on Monday morning provided the following details of the incident: the migrants left from Garabuli (Libya) after midnight between Friday and Saturday morning. After some eight to nine hours at sea, their over-crowded craft began to take on water. Many panicked and fell into the water.A Coast Guard ship arrived almost immediately and managed to rescue 86 people while recovering the remains of six women and two men. The migrants on board came mainly from Sierra Leone, Mali, Ivory Coast, Cameroon and Nigeria.According to testimony gathered by IOM in Catania, at least five of the missing are children between the ages of two and six.

(22, man)",Afghanistan,"suicide, jumped out of window of refugee accommodation in Abensbergen in fear of deportation","Suddeutsche ZeitungVon Dietrich Mittler und Lisa SchnellJanuar 2018In den offiziellen Papieren von Taher I. ist der 1. Januar als Geburtstag eingetragen – so wie das bei vielen Asylbewerbern geschieht, in deren Heimatländern Geburtsdaten keine Rolle spielen. An diesem 1. Januar beschloss der junge Afghane, seinem Leben ein Ende zu setzen. In der Nacht zum 2. Januar sprang der 22-Jährige in der Abensberger Gemeinschaftsunterkunft im zweiten Stock aus dem Fenster. Asylhelfer, die ihn näher kannten, quälen sich seitdem mit der Frage: „Hätten wir ihm helfen können?“Zugleich aber wissen sie: Solche Verzweiflungstaten sind in Bayern längst kein Einzelfall mehr. Genau ein Jahr zuvor hatte sich in der oberbayerischen Marktgemeinde Gaimersheim ein 19-jähriger Flüchtling aus Afghanistan in einem Supermarkt mit Benzin übergossen und angezündet. Gut zwei Monate später konnten Zivilbeamte in Passau einen 27-jährigen Afghanen gerade noch davon abhalten, von einer Brücke zu springen.Zumeist bleiben Verzweiflungstaten wie diese im Dunkeln. Im Fall von Taher I. trafen sich Asylhelfer und Mitbewohner des 22-Jährigen am Freitag im Herzen Abendsbergs auf dem Stadtplatz zu einer Mahnwache. Mit dabei war die 77-jährige frühere Dekanin Inge Ehemann. Zwei Tage vor Heiligabend hat sie Taher I. das letzte Mal lebend gesehen. Sie fragte ihn, wie es ihm gehe. „Gut“, antwortete er. „Wenn man Taher fragte, hat er immer gesagt: ‚Es geht mir gut.'“Der junge Mann lebte zurückgezogen, hatte psychische Probleme, die Ehemann auf traumatische Fluchterlebnisse zurückführt. Taher I. wollte und konnte darüber nicht reden. Hinzu kam: Sein Asylantrag wurde abgelehnt. Und am 23. Januar soll wieder eine Sammelabschiebung nach Afghanistan stattfinden.„Statt die Traumatisierung zu verarbeiten, kommt hier eine neue Traumatisierung hinzu“, sagt Maria Möller, Hausärztin aus Augsburg, die sich seit 2015 in der Flüchtlingsarbeit engagiert. Für viele Afghanen, seelisch ohnehin bereits angeschlagen, gleiche diese Situation „einem Russisch Roulette – wann komm ich dran mit der Abschiebung? Wann trifft es mich?“.Jürgen Soyer, der Geschäftsführer des Münchner Beratungs- und Behandlungszentrums „Refugio“ für traumatisierte Flüchtlinge und Folteropfer, geht davon aus, dass diese Angst mittlerweile selbst Flüchtlinge erfasse, die einen gesicherten Aufenthaltsstatus haben. „Mit diesen wenigen Dutzend, die man dann abschiebt, verunsichert man meines Erachtens Tausende.“ Auf den Anmeldungslisten von Refugio stünden „oft auch Leute, die bereits einen Suizidversuch hinter sich haben“. Letztlich hätte wohl auch Taher I. mehr professionellen Beistand und vor allem aber eine stabile Umgebung gebraucht. Solange er im Raum Mainburg in einer dezentralen Unterkunft lebte, hatte er einen Helferkreis, der immer wieder nach ihm sah – dazu gehörte Inge Ehemann. Dann wurde diese Unterkunft aufgelöst, und Taher I. fand sich im niederbayerischen Abensberg in einer Gemeinschaftsunterkunft wieder. Dort war der Helferkreis offenbar bereits so ausgelastet, dass er sich nicht auch noch um die neu eingetroffenen Afghanen habe kümmern können, sagt die 77-Jährige. In der Folge saß der junge Afghane Tag für Tag ohne Ablenkung in der Unterkunft – denn eine Arbeitserlaubnis bekam er auch nicht. Er war allein mit seiner Angst.",48.817718,11.850787,Abensbergen,Germany,SDZ/Thruttig,https://thruttig.wordpress.com/2018/01/09/angst-vor-abschiebung-trieb-afghanen-in-den-suizid/,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4014,Dorien,01-05-2018,New Entry,17/04/2018,Dorien

22/12/2017,22/12/17,1,Abdullah Dilsouz (15),Afghanistan,run over by refrigeration truck while walking along motorway near Calais (F) on way to Great Britain,"Migrants are still travelling to the Channel port, enduring desperate living conditions and dying on the roads, trying to get to Britain.by Amelia Gentleman in Calais, photographs by Alecsandra Raluca DragoiTue 16 Jan 2018 09.42 GMTA few hours before his death, Abdullah Dilsouz was playing cricket with other child refugees in the wasteland behind the port of Calais. Friends said he was excited to be nearing the end of a long journey from Afghanistan, and optimistic that he would soon be able to join his brother in London.But the 15-year-old was run over by a refrigeration truck on 22 December – one of three asylum-seekers to be killed on the roads outside the port in the past month. A fourth has been seriously injured and remains in a coma in hospital and on Sunday night an Iraqi refugee had his legs severed by a train near Dunkirk.The Calais camp explainedCharities say the deaths are the result of worsening living conditions for migrants in northern France, prompting them to take more risks as they try to reach the UK.As the French president, Emmanuel Macron, travels to Calais on Tuesday to discuss the re-emerging refugee population with charities and local officials before a summit with Theresa May on Thursday, the dire conditions in which about 80 unaccompanied child asylum-seekers are living is again high on the political agenda.French media say Macron plans to ask May to allow in unaccompanied children and adults with family in the UK, and demand more money to help in managing the migrant crisis in northern France.France will not allow another refugee camp in Calais, says MacronThe death of Abdullah, who had a legal right to come to the UK under family reunification legislation, made few headlines in France where migrant deaths have become routine (there have been more than 200 since 1999). But it triggered profound anguish among the local charities that were trying to help him to safety.The charity Safe Passage has launched a petition calling on the French and British governments to ensure that there are no more deaths at the border. They hope that ministers at the Anglo-French summit this week will agree to speed up asylum processes and make safe and legal routes for child refugees travelling to the UK more accessible.Jan Agha, 21, was with Abdullah, his cousin, on the night he died. Both came from a small village in Nangarhar province, a unsettled area of eastern Afghanistan where the Taliban and Islamic State have been vying for control.After a long journey across Europe, neither had any money to pay people smugglers to help them get across the Channel, so every night they were trying to make their way independently, waiting near motorway junctions close to the port, hoping that lorries would slow down sufficiently for them to take a chance to climb on and conceal themselves.Jan Agha was with his cousin when he died.“There is no safe way to do it; it is really dangerous every time you try,” Agha said, speaking through an interpreter. “That night neither of us much wanted to walk to the motorway – we were exhausted. But it was cold in the woods where we were sleeping, so we decided to try again.”Abdullah was walking along the road behind his cousin. Sometime after 11pm Agha turned to check the boy was still following him and saw him being hit by a lorry travelling very fast towards the port. The driver did not stop, but the truck dragged the 15-year-old along the road for about 100 metres. When Agha found the body of his cousin, he passed out from the shock.Someone called the police, but the driver has not been found. Agha spent a few hours in hospital and gave details of the incident to the police, before returning to sleep in a tent in the woods. He is so traumatised by the experience that he has abandoned his own attempts to travel to the UK and hopes to claim asylum in France. But the process of registering is not easy and, in the meantime, he continues to be harassed by local police who recently sprayed teargas at him as he slept.Every few days police arrive at the woods, a few hundred metres from the site of the old camp, which was demolished in October 2016. The officers ask the several hundred people from Eritrea, Sudan, Ethiopia and Afghanistan who are living in the woods to move on. Refuse collectors remove tents and sleeping bags.Refugees living in the woods near Calais.Charities say about 1,000 migrants are living in small encampments in Calais and Dunkirk, most of them hoping to travel to the UK because they have family there. Local authorities are determined to avoid a return of the scale of the previous camp, where an estimated 10,000 migrants were crammed in close confinement, and make life uncomfortable for migrants in the (largely mistaken) belief that this will stop people from coming.A report published late last year by Helprefugees concluded that sanitation conditions fell “significantly short” of internationally recognised humanitarian standards and warned of a “threat to public health”.A recent UN report criticised the arrangements for safe drinking water and sanitation with 700 migrants relying on just 10 portable toilets and water from 10 taps.“Conditions have really deteriorated in the past few months; there has been more violence from police, more action taken to dissuade people from being here. Any sign of a new camp is demolished. Police spray teargas on possessions and you can’t sleep in a sleeping bag that has been sprayed,” said Rowan Farrell, a volunteer with the Refugee Info Bus.When temperatures drop below zero, a warehouse opens its doors, offering about 200 spaces to sleep. There has been unhappiness that the centre has remained mostly closed this winter, but unexpectedly opened its door for two nights before Macron’s visit, despite the relatively mild temperatures.Abdullah had been in Calais for about 45 days, and had been upset by conditions. “We had nowhere to live, no water. We didn’t know it would be like this,” Agha said. “But he was very happy that he was almost there. He was hoping to get to London to see his brother who he last saw seven years ago. England seemed so close, he wanted to keep trying to get there.”He described Abdullah as a very calm, intelligent person who wanted to continue his education. He brought out his phone, to show a picture of Abdullah in the mortuary covered up to the neck with a white sheet. “I want to make sure no one else suffers like this.”The Refugee Youth Service had contacted local authorities on Abdullah’s behalf on 14 December, alerting them that there was an unaccompanied child in danger and in need of child protection services. Sabriya Guivy, legal adviser with the charity, said there was no space in December in the emergency shelters for young people, and there was also a confusion over his name. He was not offered somewhere to stay.Legal volunteers were prepared to help him with a reunification application to allow him to join his 19-year-old brother in London, but these take so long and are not always successful, so it is hard to persuade young people to stop risking their lives on the road.A week after Abdullah’s death a truck carrying rolls of paper drove into a ditch, and a migrant was found crushed beneath the paper inside. Last week, on 9 January, another migrant was found on the A16; the cause of death was believed to be falling from a moving vehicle.Loan Torondel, who manages the local charity L’Auberge des Migrants, is angry that responsibility often falls on him, an untrained 21-year-old, to call the relatives of the dead. “Normally if a child dies in a road accident, the authorities will call the family to explain. In Calais that’s not the case. We have to do it,” he said. His organisation raised money for Abdullah’s body to be repatriated.Volunteers at a warehouse run by L’Auberge des Migrants.“It’s very difficult explaining to the parents what happened because they don’t understand about the conditions in Calais. I don’t know what to say when they ask me: ‘Why did you let my child climb on a moving trucks to try to go to Britain?’ It feels really wrong when relatives travel to Calais, and there is only us to meet them at the station, no one from the prefecture.”French and British politicians needed to understand that the situation in Calais is not going to disappear and that life needs to be made safer and more humane for refugees, Torondel added. “People die because they don’t have a safe and sure way to cross the border. We need dignified accommodation for the refugees, we need better processes for claiming asylum in France, we need faster legal routes for people to be reunited with their family in the UK.”",50.965766,1.871723,Calais,France,Guardian/CMS,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/16/england-seemed-so-close-refugee-15-crushed-to-death-by-calais-lorry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3990,Dorien,17-04-2018,New Entry,09/04/2018,Eymert
21/12/2017,21/12/17,1,"N.N. (15, boy)",Afghanistan,hit by truck on ring road leading to the port of Calais (France),"Un migrant de nationalité afghane est mort dans la nuit de jeudi à vendredi après avoir été probablement percuté par un véhicule sur la rocade menant au port de Calais, a-t-on appris auprès de la préfecture. Il s’agirait d’un mineur d’une quinzaine d’années. Jeudi vers 23 h 30, «  sur la rocade portuaire dans le sens Calais-port », un migrant «  a été retrouvé mort, probablement percuté par un véhicule qui a pris la fuite », a indiqué la préfecture du Pas-de-Calais.«  Au regard des premières constatations, il pourrait s’agir d’un individu de nationalité afghane », selon la préfecture, précisant qu’une enquête de police avait été ouverte. Le procureur de la République, Pascal Marconville, indique que la victime pourrait être mineure : «  Il semble très jeune selon les enquêteurs qui étaient sur place, peut-être une quinzaine d’années  ». Aucun conducteur n’a signalé avoir eu un accident sur la rocade, aucun témoin ne s’est manifesté. Des dispositions ont été prises immédiatement après la découverte du corps. «  Des vérifications ont été faites sur les véhicules à l’embarquement, en direction de l’Angleterre, à la recherche d’éventuelles traces de choc, mais sans résultat  », précise le procureur.Le préfet du Pas-de-Calais Fabien Sudry a informé mercredi qu’entre 350 et 400 migrants se trouvent à Calais, selon la dernière estimation. Le préfet indiquait également il y a deux semaines dans nos colonnes que 41 barrages ou tentatives ont été enregistrés sur l’A16 depuis le début de l’année (contre plusieurs centaines en 2015 et 2016). Concernant l’éclairage de l’autoroute et de la rocade portuaire, Fabien Sudry évoquait une remise en service vers février-mars 2018. Le coût de cette mesure est d’environ 5 millions d’euros et serait pris en charge par le gouvernement britannique.Pression migratoire : troisième mort sur l’A16 en 2017Ce n’est pas le premier drame survenu sur l’A16 et la rocade depuis le début de l’année. En janvier, un Éthiopien de 20 ans a été écrasé sur l’A16 par un camion, vers 8 h. Puis, le 20 juin, suite à des barrages de troncs d’arbres posés par des migrants, un Polonais qui conduisait une camionnette, a été tué au milieu de la nuit. C’était la première fois qu’un conducteur a perdu la vie suite à la pose d’un barrage. Au cours de l’année 2016, 14 migrants avaient perdu la vie dans le Calaisis, 9 d’entre-eux avaient été percutés sur la rocade ou l’A16.Le mineur isolé avait été signalé par les associationsLes associations d’aides aux migrants sont effondrées par ce nouveau drame, avec la mort d’un mineur afghan dont la présence avait été signalée. «  Nous avons adressé au Département une information préoccupante à son sujet la semaine dernière, rapporte, désabusée, une bénévole. Les associations ont l’obligation de signaler ces situations, c’est ensuite aux autorités de faire le nécessaire. » L’adolescent «  dormait dans la rue  » et, selon la bénévole, «  avait un frère en Angleterre, donc il devait pouvoir bénéficier d’une voie légale pour le rejoindre. Si cette voie légale fonctionnait, il n’aurait pas eu à monter dans des camions. Ces moyens légaux sont lents et inefficaces. »Selon l’Auberge des migrants, 200 mineurs isolés sont ainsi répertoriés, après leur passage à Calais depuis le démantèlement de la « jungle ». «  Ils sont en errance, dans le Calaisis, dans le Dunkerquois, en Belgique…  » Depuis un an, seules quatre procédures de réunification familiale auraient été possibles. -- « Identités différentes »Dans un communiqué envoyé ce dimanche, le conseil départemental du Pas-de-Calais, qui a en charge l’accueil d’urgence des mineurs isolés, indique qu’il déplore ce drame et tient à préciser : «  Bien que le Département et France Terre d’asile aient mis en place, dès 2012, un dispositif de mise à l’abri inconditionnel pour les mineurs non accompagnés, cet enfant était inconnu des services du Département et de ceux de son partenaire. Aucune information préoccupante n’a été enregistrée par les services du Département, au nom de cet enfant, mais le Conseil départemental sait que ces jeunes peuvent fournir des identités différentes à leurs interlocuteurs.  »",50.972546,1.890593,Calais,France,VoixDuNord/Express,http://www.lavoixdunord.fr/285194/article/2017-12-22/le-migrant-afghan-percute-sur-la-rocade-portuaire-etait-un-mineur-isole,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3962,Dorien,15-05-2018,New Entry,08/02/2018,Klara

They had left at midnight (local Moroccan time) from Tangier and our contact person told us that their rubber boats were losing air. They did not have engines but only paddles. The last contact to the boat people was at 5am, and in the exchange the people had spoken about dramatically deteriorating weather conditions. Our shift team was unable to reach the people directly, and so we contacted the Spanish search and rescue organisation Salvamento Maritimo (SM) at 5.51am. We were informed that SM was involved in search and rescue activities concerning 5 boats, approximately in the same area. They had rescued a small boat already, carrying 9 people. At 7.40am, SM confirmed that they had rescued two rubber boats, but it was not possible to verify whether these were the boats we had been alerted to. At 11.24am, our contact person in Morocco stated that the boat with 11 people had returned to Morocco and the travellers were currently in a hospital. We informed SM about this a minute later, and they stated that they were still looking for a boat with 6 people, after just having rescued a boat with 7 people. At 11.41am we learned that on the boat that had returned to Morocco there had been 10 instead of 11 people, but one person went missing after he had gone overboard. Later we found out that the group had stranded at the harbour of Tangiers after they had not succeeded to get far out into the Strait of Gibraltar. Exhausted, they were unable to land their boat and were near a cliff. One person tried to climb it but fell into the water. They were then rescued by a small vessel from the harbour with a single captain, but one person remains missing. SM later tweeted that they had rescued people from 5 boats.

Ademt hij nog?’’,,Ik wist meteen dat er iets ernstigs aan de hand was. Er kwam ook direct een geruchtenstroom op gang: was hij vermoord? Wat was er gebeurd? Het was een rare ochtend.’’Later die dag wordt het in een blauwe doek gewikkelde lichaam op een draagbaar in de auto van de begrafenisonderneming gereden. Bewoners kijken toe, maken foto’s en filmpjes. ,,Een Zuid-Amerikaan’’, zeggen ze, want Nagel woonde in Mexico. ,,Hij was journalist, hij zat altijd achter zijn computer”, zeggen anderen. Het waarom van zijn daad weet niemand.Bang voor de CIATurksma sprak een aantal keren met Nagel: ,,Hij maakte een heel leuke indruk, je kon goed met hem praten. Hij wist dat hij terug moest naar de Verenigde Staten en dat wilde hij ook wel.’’Ze bespeurde in haar contacten geen bijzonderheden, maar Truus Bruintjes van de Evangelische kerk in het nabijgelegen Roswinkel weet dat de man bang was om terug te gaan: ,,Hij was bang om vermoord te worden door de CIA.’’    Hij had bewijzen dat de CIA de hersenen van mensen kon beïnvloeden en hij dacht ook dat zijn hersenen waren gemanipuleerdBruintjes leerde hem kennen op de terugkeerlocatie, de VBL, waar ze met regelmaat komt om de uitgeprocedeerde asielzoekers een hart onder de riem te steken. ,,Wij nemen ze op zondag vaak mee naar onze gebedsdiensten in Roswinkel, en ook wel naar de bidstonde. Hij vond dat leuk en was altijd hulpvaardig, bijvoorbeeld met stoelen klaarzetten. Of hijzelf gelovig was weet ik zo niet, maar hij stond er wel open voor.’’ De laatste zondag voor zijn dood was hij niet meegegaan naar de kerk. Volgens Bruintjes voelde hij zich niet zo lekker.Ondanks zijn vriendelijkheid was er wel iets met Nagel aan de hand, zegt Bruintjes: ,,Hij had het altijd over kunstmatige intelligentie, hij had bewijzen dat de CIA de hersenen van mensen kon beïnvloeden en hij dacht ook dat zijn hersenen waren gemanipuleerd. In teksten op internet las hij boodschappen die speciaal voor hem bedoeld waren. Dat maakte hem angstig.’’PoederbrievenJohn Nagel was Amerikaans staatsburger maar woonde met vrouw en dochter in Mexico City. Hij komt net uit een Amerikaanse gevangenis in Florida als hij medio 2017 in Nederland arriveert om asiel aan te vragen. Op internet staat een persbericht van 1 juni 2016 van het Openbaar Ministerie van de Amerikaanse staat Florida dat verklaart waarom hij gevangen zat.Nagel is in de zomer van 2016 veroordeeld tot een jaar gevangenisstraf vanwege het versturen van poederbrieven vanuit Mexico City aan 37 prominente politici in de Verenigde Staten. Na onderzoek blijkt het te gaan om relatief onschuldig bi-carbonaat. De brieven beginnen met een waarschuwing: ‘adem niet in, giftige inhoud’ en eindigen met een bijbeltekst.Nagel is dan 47 jaar. Hij noemt zichzelf journalist, publiceert veel op internet en heeft een vertaalbureau. Eenmaal vrijgelaten uit de gevangenis in Florida reist hij terug naar zijn familie in Mexico. Dat gebeurt illegaal omdat hij vanwege zijn veroordeling in de VS niet meer welkom is in Mexico. De betreffende pagina’s in zijn Amerikaanse paspoort waarin dat staat heeft hij uit zijn paspoort gescheurd.Dan besluit hij naar Nederland af te reizen en hij vraagt asiel aan. Nagel denkt dat de CIA achter hem aan zit, en in Mexico is hij niet meer welkom. (tekst leest door na foto)Veilig landIn Ter Apel wordt zijn asielaanvraag snel afgewezen: de Verenigde Staten is een veilig land, asiel is niet aan de orde. Maar Nagel is ziek, stelt zijn advocaat Radjinder Nohar uit Lemmer. Zijn cliënt is schizofreen. Die diagnose noteert de dienstdoende huisarts van het Gezondheidscentrum asielzoekers (GCA) op 12 augustus in het medisch verslag. ,,Ik heb daarom eind augustus bij de IND uitstel van vertrek aangevraagd, omdat ik vond dat hij in deze toestand niet kon terugkeren’’, zegt raadsman Nohar, ,,maar ik denk niet dat artsen van de IND hem vervolgens hebben onderzocht.’’Nagel kreeg het middel olanzapine voorgeschreven, een medicijn dat wanen en hallucinaties remt. Het wordt gebruikt bij psychoses. Nagel was bekend in Ter Apel, want opmerkelijk genoeg was hij in 2014 – voor zijn actie met de poederbrieven – ook al eens als asielzoeker naar Nederland gereisd om asiel aan te vragen.Ook toen, in 2014, stelde de medische dienst vast dat hij aan schizofrenie leed. Na afwijzing van zijn asielaanvraag reisde Nagel destijds zelfstandig terug naar huis.In de warAls zijn volgende asielaanvraag in de zomer van 2017 wordt afgewezen, wordt Nagel in de ‘vrijheidsbeperkende locatie’ (de VBL) gehuisvest en volgen gesprekken over zijn terugkeer. De verslagen van de terugkeergesprekken werpen licht op de worsteling van Nagel met zijn terugkeer.Betrokkene verklaart dat hij in de war is noteert de ambtenaar die met hem over terugkeer praat. ,,Hij is nerveus omdat hij een vijand van de Amerikaanse overheid is, en vervolgd wordt.’’De vorige keer is Nagel zelfstandig teruggekeerd naar zijn gezin in Mexico, en dat wil hij nu ook het liefst. Maar hij weet niet hoe hij moet terugreizen want zijn paspoort is niet geldig omdat hij de pagina met een ongeldig visum voor Mexico eruit heeft gescheurd. Nu is hij bang dat hij gedwongen terug moet naar de VS.Het dilemma waarvoor Nagel staat wordt duidelijk uit de verslagen van de terugkeergesprekken: ‘Op zijn vraag of ik wil overwegen hem terug te laten keren naar Mexico geef ik aan dat als hij mij een verblijfsvergunning voor Mexico kan tonen, ik bereid ben om te kijken naar de terugkeermogelijkheden’ noteert de terugkeerambtenaar in Ter Apel op 12 september.    Die diagnose kende ik niet, maar er was ondanks zijn vriendelijkheid wel iets mis met hemMaar hoe komt Nagel, zonder geldig paspoort, aan een verblijfsvergunning voor Mexico? En als dat niet lukt wacht terugkeer naar de VS waarmee hij – in zijn waangedachte – op voet van oorlog verkeert. Nog voor het Amerikaanse consulaat een nieuw paspoort heeft gemaakt, neemt de paniek op fatale wijze bezit van Nagel.De Dienst Terugkeer en Vertrek, waarmee Nagel in Ter Apel te maken had, wil niet zeggen of de diagnose schizofrenie bekend was bij de dienst en hoe daarmee werd omgegaan. Ook de vraag of het overlijden voor de medewerkers onverwacht kwam wil de dienst niet beantwoorden. ,,Wij gaan nooit in op individuele gevallen.’’Petra Turksma van vluchtelingenwerk en Truus Bruintjes van de kerk waren er in ieder geval niet van op de hoogte. Toch is Truus Bruintjes niet verbaasd: ,,Die diagnose kende ik niet, maar er was ondanks zijn vriendelijkheid wel iets mis met hem. Hij had het altijd over de CIA.’’Geen antwoordJacqueline Engberts, woordvoerder van het COA en verantwoordelijk voor de huisvesting op de terugkeerlocatie wil, net als DT & V, evenmin ingaan op de suïcide van Nagel. Het enige wat ze kwijt wil is dat er grote verslagenheid was onder het personeel, en dat in overleg met de familie in Mexico besloten is Nagel in Ter Apel te begraven.Op de vraag of COA medewerkers op de hoogte waren van zijn diagnose, en of Nagel besproken is in het overleg over problematische bewoners wil zij geen antwoord geven.Een paar dagen na zijn dood wordt Nagel begraven in Ter Apel. Petra Turksma van Vluchtelingenwerk is er, iemand van het COA en enkele medebewoners. Het COA spreekt niet op de begrafenis van een van zijn bewoners, maar laat dat over aan Truus Bruintjes van de kerk in Roswinkel.Of zijn dood was te voorkomen met een intensieve medische begeleiding is niet te zeggen, stelt advocaat Nohar. ,,Ik heb de IND tweemaal aangeschreven om een medisch advies te laten opstellen. Helaas heb ik nooit iets vernomen van de IND, de medische adviseur van de IND of de arts van Nagel.’’De advocaat hoort niks meer. Enkele uren na Nagels dood schrijft de terugkeerambtenaar van de dienst terugkeer en vertrek in Ter Apel een uiterst curieuze brief, geadresseerd aan John Milton Nagel: ‘Geachte Heer Nagel, vanwege uw overlijden op 16 oktober 2017 wordt de aan u opgelegde maatregel (….) om de vrijheid van bewegen te beperken, per heden beëindigd.’",52.885971,7.029513,Ter Apel,Netherlands,DVHN,http://www.dvhn.nl/extra/Zelfmoord-van-een-Amerikaanse-asielzoeker-in-vertrekcentrum-Ter-Apel-22836062.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,4278,Klara,28/05/2018,New Entry,28/05/2018,Klara

The migrant boat is believed to have left the Tunisian port of Sfax and to have been heading towards Sicily.The military vessel reportedly approached the fishing boat to identify who was on board when the collision happened.The Tunisian defence ministry has opened an investigation into the accident.

03/10/2017,03/10/17,1,Carrington Spencer,Jamaica,"had a stroke on 28Sep17 in Morton Hall Detention centre (GB), died of lack of medical care","IRC Morton Hall05/10/2017Re: Death Incident (IRC Morton Hall)Dear UnityThank you so much for your texts this morning. I have now gathered all the information from main witnesses and even have couple of written statements.Mr Carlinton Spencer was a detainee here at Morton Hall. Unfortunately Mr Spencer aka (Rasta) died in hospital on the 2nd of October 2017.This whole ordeal started on Thursday the 28th of September 2017 when two of Mr Spencer’s friends turned at his room in Fry Unity 3/06. They noticed that the door was unlocked and the room was dark, however they heard some sort of distress voice coming from inside. They both came in and switched the lights on. They found Mr Spencer lying in floor in agony and unable to get back in bed. They assisted him and put him on his bed. One of them went to the office in Fry unit and informed the officers. Two female officers arrived an started speculating that Mr Spencer’s condition was induced by drugs consumption. Few minutes later a nurse came in and failed to assess Mr Spencer’s conditions properly. The nurse put a tissue on Mr Spencer’s hand, asked him to wipe his own nose when she could clearly see this was not possible. According to these two detainee’s testimony the nurse assisted Mr Spencer’s hands to wipe his own nose but his hand kept pulling back down. The officers and the nurse asked Rasta’s two friends to leave the room but one of them insisted to stay.On Friday the 29th of September 2017 about midday, another detainee went to Mr Spencer’s room to check on him. But this point Mr Spencer was shaking in his bed and looking in a very bad state. This detainee informed the officers in Fry unit while another detainee went to the health care and dragged the medical professional to come to check on Mr Spencer’s conditions. Few detainees were standing outside Mr Spencer’s door when the nurse and doctor arrived. The officers asked the detained to go away but they decided they would not leave until Mr Spencer is taking to a hospital. An ambulance arrived at about 2pm and Mr Spencer was then taken to hospital.It has now been said that Mr. Spence suffered another stroke while in the back of the ambulance on his way to hospital and in fact he was in a (non induced) coma in hospital and died on Monday 2nd of October 2017. We were not told by IRC Morton Hall staff of this until Wednesday 4th of October 2017.On Monday, I personally asked one of the officers in Windsor Unit what were the conditions of Rasta and if he had an update, the officer in question told me he did not know about that incident as he was off on Friday. I found that extremely hard to believe but I continue with my activities.Yesterday 3rd of October 2017 at around 19:00 hours the news started circulating that Mr Spencer has passed away in hospital. I was shocked and deeply traumatized when I heard the news because I personally knew him. He was a very pleasant and decent gentleman.By 20>30, final roll check time, the officers at Windsor Unit were trying to calm down a few of the detainees that were deeply distress, They lady officer claimed that Rasta died as result of spice attack. This is very misleading and untrue. He died as a result of gross negligence from part of the health professional at Morton Hall and IRC staff that failed to identify Mr Spencer had a stroke on 28 of September 2017.Such a gross negligence could potentially revoke a doctor’s license to practice from the GMC register. I come from a medical background environment and I understand this subject in depth. The GMC will rule that doctor is unfit to practice. However there are no Doctors here at IRC Morton Hall between 17:00-09:00. Here at Morton Hall detainees are 16 hours without a doctor. We only have nurses that do not meet the standards of a medical professional and lack insight and professionalism, obviously disregarding their patient’s duty of care. I believe in this case the protocol would have been to ring an ambulance straight away on Thursday. Perhaps this would have change the whole outcome.I know one detainee Mr T put a written complaint on Saturday because he directly witnessed what happen to Mr Spencer and how he was neglected. Mr T was moved to the CCU on Monday 2nd of October 2017 in the afternoon and now has been moved out of this centre but no one can get a hold of him.This should have never happened if proper medical care has been offered in time to minimize the negatives effect of a stroke. This is shocking and it revolts me to my core knowing that IRC Morton Hall staff are insisting that MR Spencer died as a result of spice attack.  This has spared anger among the population her. I am personally very distressed, traumatized and angry as his is the second death incident I have experience while in detention.Thank you for your support, we really appreciate it.Kind RegardsConcerned Detainees at IRC Morton Hall",53.167904,-0.689086,Morton Hall,GB,IRR/No-DFeportation/Symaag,https://www.symaag.org.uk/2017/10/10/another-person-dies-at-morton-hall-a-letter-from-detainees/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,3985,Klara,19/04/2018,New Entry,29/03/2018,Dorien

He provided us with a phone number and suggested that they might still be close to the Moroccan coast. At 10.38am, we reached the travellers via phone and they told us that water was entering their boat and that they could barely move, being only equipped with paddles. They immediately asked for helped and we asked several times if we should also call the Moroccan Marine Royale. They said yes, because they were very much afraid to die. After another conversation with the contact person, we decided to call the Moroccan Marine Royal at 11am, who promised to send a rescue boat. At 11.20am, the contact person confirmed to us that he saw a Search and Rescue vessel leaving the port of Tanger. At 11.25am, we called the travellers again and informed them that a rescue vessel was on its way to them. Afterwards, we were not able to reach them anymore. Thus, at about noon, we wrote an email to the Spanish rescue organization Salvamento Maritimo and to the UNHCR Spain, alerting and providing them with all the information we had received so far. At 1.15pm, the contact person informed us that he had heard from other persons that the Moroccan Marine Royale had rescued the travellers. In order to verify this information, we called the Marine Royale at 2pm and they confirmed to us that the travellers from this boat had indeed been rescued. However, later on, our contact person spoke to the travellers and was told that one person died on the boat and that his lifleless body had fallen into the water during the ongoing rescue operation of the Moroccan Marine Royale. The dead person was left behind in the sea.

Según el testimonio de los supervivientes a miembros del Frontex pasadas las primeras horas, en la neumática viajarían un total de diez personas, por lo que la búsqueda inicial que se hacía de cuatro desaparecidos se ha amplió a seis hombres. Durante las labores de rastreo este jueves, un buque reportó sobre las 11,30 horas al centro de coordinación de Almería el avistamiento de los restos de una embarcación, que por sus características y posición, podría ser la patera en la que viajaban los náufragos.

Los rescatadores auxiliaron a tres hombres, que carecían de chaleco salvavidas, y recuperaron un cadáver. LA PATERA VOLCÓ POR ""MAL TIEMPO"" Según el testimonio de los supervivientes, todos adultos y de origen argelino, la embarcación habría diez personas que cayeron al mar debido a que la neumática volcó por las malas condiciones del mar, de forma que cuando fueron encontrados llevaban ""bastante tiempo"" en el mar.

The Home Office, however, repeatedly refused to confirm the accounts.It issued a statement on Friday saying: “We can confirm that a 28-year-old man recently released from Harmondsworth immigration removal centre died in hospital after life support was withdrawn on Thursday 7 September.”It remains unclear why the man was being held in the centre.The Home Office declined to confirm whether he had been released from detention before or after the incident on Sunday. When asked whether confirmation of the incident had been delayed so as not to be made public at the same time as the Panorama programme, a Home Office spokeswoman replied: “Absolutely not.”The centre manager, Paul Morrison, circulated a letter to detainees on Friday, stating that the detainee was taken to hospital after he tried to kill himself and that some detainees tried to help him immediately after the incident.“This is clearly a very sad and tragic event,” Morrison wrote.According to Harmondsworth detainees, the man’s mother travelled by bus from Poland to see her son before the life support machine was turned off. The detainees said the man had been granted bail two weeks before the incident, but the Home Office had failed to release him. The Home Office declined to comment on this claim.One detainee, who was a friend of the man, said: “He had physical and emotional problems but didn’t get the help he needed from the detention healthcare service. The day before the incident he was crying like a baby and saying about healthcare: ‘Why don’t you help me, why ignore me?’”Fifty-nine detainees at Harmondsworth signed a protest letter after the death saying: “It’s a disgrace that no one has been held accountable for such poor care. We are human beings not animals.”Emma Ginn, the coordinator of Medical Justice, a charity that works to improve the healthcare of immigration detainees, said: “Earlier this week we called on the Home Office to close all immigration removal centres before another detainee dies. Another detainee died last night. This death, like all the others, was avoidable as immigration detention is optional.“Clients have been calling us all week, traumatised by having seen what they say was a dead body, and terrified by their treatment and the conditions in immigration detention … We call again for the immediate closure of all immigration removal centres before yet another detainee dies.”Forty-one people have died in immigration detention or shortly after release since 2000.The Home Office spokeswoman said: “Our thoughts are with [the man’s] family at this very sad time. A full independent investigation will be conducted by the prisons and probation ombudsman.”",51.487453,-0.475554,Harmondsworth,GB,Guardian/IRR,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/09/polish-immigrant-dies-after-suicide-attempt-in-uk-detention-centre,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,3885,Dorien,12-04-2018,New Entry,28/09/2017,Klara

(6 women; 10 men),Africa,"10 drowned, 100 missing in several incidents on the way from Libya to Italy; 1650 rescued that day","HomeWorld News Over 2,500 migrants rescued in Mediterranean in 2 days – UN Published time: 11 Jun, 2017 17:53 Edited time: 12 Jun, 2017 06:41 More than 2,500 migrants were rescued off the Libyan coast in the past 48 hours while attempting to cross the Mediterranean in “flimsy dinghies,” the UN refugee agency has said. At least eight people have died and dozens are feared missing. “Eight corpses have been recovered so far and at least 52 people are feared missing from two incidents involving large numbers of people on flimsy dinghies off the coast of Libya on Saturday,” Director of Europe Bureau of the UN Refugee agency (UNHCR) Vincent Cochetel said in a statement, citing the Italian Coast Guard.In all, over a dozen search-and-rescue operations, coordinated by the Italian Coast Guard, were launched over the weekend. The rescued migrants are expected to be disembarked in Italy over the next few days, the agency added. “UNHCR applauds the rescue efforts by European government authorities, the Italian Coast Guard and NGOs, but is deeply saddened that the death toll continues to rise,” the statement reads.Over 1,770 people are estimated to have perished or gone missing while trying to cross the Mediterranean so far this year, according to agency’s estimates, while more than 50,000 migrants reached Italian shores, most of them through Libya.The death toll among migrants trying to reach Europe is believed to be much higher, according to the UNHCR, though, as many of them presumably die in the Sahara desert without even making it to the Libyan coast.The migrant death toll is expected to spike in the next few months with the beginning of summer sailing season, the agency warns.While urging to strengthen international efforts to save people attempting to cross the Mediterranean, UNHCR stated that the “solutions cannot just be in Italy.” Italy has on numerous occasions said that it does not enough resources to deal with the migrant influx from Libya.“The mixed flows of people through East and West Africa towards Sudan, Niger and Libya continue unmanaged, and cruel smuggling networks flourish,” the statement reads. “We urgently need renewed efforts to find different solutions for refugees and migrants in the countries they cross before they reach Libya, given the insecurity in that country and vulnerability of people on the move to horrific exploitation and abuse.”The agency also called for the development of “alternative and safe pathways” so that the people would not “undertake such dangerous journeys” to Europe. “For those in need of international protection, alternatives include family reunification, resettlement, refugee scholarships and private sponsorship,” the statement reads.The proposed “alternatives” echo the measures discussed by G7 leaders during a recent summit in Sicily, with a focus on providing greater assistance to African countries to encourage potential migrants to stay home instead of setting off on the dangerous journey to Europe.No concrete plan of action, however, was agreed upon during the summit, as the leaders only managed to “reaffirm the sovereign rights of states to control their own borders and set clear limits on net migration levels.”--NYTimes:The bodies of 10 migrants were recovered and at least 100 more migrants were missing on Saturday off the coast of Libya. Eight of the bodies were found on an inflatable boat in the Mediterranean Sea, in a treacherous area between Libya and Italy known as the Central Mediterranean route.

(5, boy)",Russia,murdered by a man residing at the same refugee shelter; authorities knew the man was dangerous," A knife-wielding attacker from Afghanistan has captured and lethally injured a 5-year-old boy and wounded his Russian mother in the Bavarian municipality of Arnschwang. The carnage unfolded in the migrant shelter on Saturday afternoon, police report.Police, who had promptly arrived at the scene, shot dead the assailant, who was identified in a police report as a 41-year-old Afghan national, a resident of the same shelter as his victims.The police were alerted to the incident via an emergency call at about 16:50 local time. The caller said that the man had got hold of a boy and was attacking him with a knife. Before being neutralized, the perpetrator also injured the boy’s mother, a 47-year-old Russian national, who was taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. Her other child, a six-year old boy, who was present at the scene at the time of the brutal attack, was deeply shaken but physically unharmed, police said. He was also brought to the hospital. A crisis intervention unit is attending to both child and mother at the hospital. So far, it is not clear what prompted the attack, and police have launched an investigation.“The investigation is at the very beginning,” Bavarian state police said in a statement.Meanwhile, the Russian Embassy in Germany said that it has been looking into the reports, along with the Russian consulate in Munich, of an attack in which Russian citizens might have been affected, the embassy’s spokesman, Denis Mikerin, told RIA Novosti.“At the present moment, we are working in cooperation with local law enforcement to establish if the victims have Russian citizenship.

Seven ambulances and two helicopters were taking part in the effort.Commenting on the incident, the head of the Arnschwang government, Michael Multerer, told the outlet he was shocked by the atrocity, noting that the authorities had no negative experience with the facility in the past. Multerer said the boys, whom he personally knew, have been living in the shelter for several years already, adding that both of them have since mastered good German. He described their mother as a quiet and a nice woman.    In the aftermath of the incident, police cordoned off the shelter and asked all its 18 residents, including three children, to vacate the premises. They are expected to be resettled in temporary accommodation.--Sueddeutsche Zeitung:Versäumnisse im Fall Arnschwang wohl größer als gedacht     Das Münchner Verwaltungsgericht hielt es für wahrscheinlich, dass Mostafa K. nach seiner Haftstrafe wegen Brandstiftung weitere Straftaten begehen würde.    Trotzdem quartierten die Behörden ihn in einer Arnschwanger Flüchtlingsunterkunft ein, wo er einen fünfjährigen Jungen tötete.    Nun stellt sich die Frage, ob die Behörden ausreichend über die Gefährlichkeit von Mostafa K. informiert waren.Von Andreas Glas und Lisa Schnell, ArnschwangDie Versäumnisse im Fall des Messerangreifers von Arnschwang scheinen größer zu sein als gedacht. Das Münchner Verwaltungsgericht hielt Mostafa K. einem Beschluss von 2014 zufolge für gemeingefährlich, bescheinigte ihm erhebliche kriminelle Energie und hielt es für wahrscheinlich, dass er im Anschluss an seine Gefängnisstrafe wegen Brandstiftung weitere Straftaten begeht.Trotzdem quartierten die zuständigen Behörden den Afghanen nach seiner Haftentlassung wohl ohne spezielle Sicherheitsvorkehrungen in der Arnschwanger Unterkunft ein, in der auch alleinstehende Frauen und Kinder lebten. Dort tötete Mostafa K. am vergangenen Samstag einen Fünfjährigen und verletzte dessen Mutter schwer. Die Polizei erschoss den Angreifer am Tatort.Die neuen Erkenntnisse bringen Freistaat und Regierung der Oberpfalz in Erklärungsnot, die gemeinsam für die Unterbringung des verurteilten Straftäters zuständig waren. Die Bezirksregierung hatte am Montag betont, es habe ""keine Anhaltspunkte"" gegeben, ""dass es zu einer solchen Eskalation"" kommen könnte. Doch waren die Warnungen des Verwaltungsgerichts nicht Anhaltspunkt genug, den Täter für gefährlich zu halten?Im Sommer 2014 bestätigte das Gericht die Prognose der JVA Landsberg am Lech, ""dass in Zukunft eine Gefahr für die Allgemeinheit durch neue vergleichbare Straftaten (...) ernsthaft droht"". Explizit hieß es, dass ""ohne adäquate Behandlungsmaßnahmen die Gefahr erneuter schwerwiegender Straftaten gegen Leib und Leben anderer Personen ausgehe"". Zudem wurde Mostafa K. eine ""Sucht- und Gewaltproblematik"" bescheinigt.Während der Haft sei Mostafa K. ebenfalls ""erheblich und wiederholt in disziplinarisch relevanter Weise"" aufgefallen. Seine frühere Ehefrau etwa soll er aus dem Gefängnis heraus angerufen und mit dem Tod bedroht haben. Auch das Landgericht Augsburg betonte nach der Haftentlassung das weiterhin hohe Gefährdungspotenzial. Um zu verhindern, dass er sich seiner früheren Frau wieder nähert, musste Mostafa K. fortan eine Fußfessel tragen - die aber keinen Schutz für die Bewohner der Unterkunft in Arnschwang bedeutete.Gerichtlich verordnetes Anti-Gewalt-TrainingNun stellt sich die Frage, ob die Behörden ausreichend über die Gefährlichkeit des Afghanen informiert waren - und warum offenbar keine wirksamen Schutzmaßnahmen für dessen Mitbewohner in der Asylunterkunft ergriffen wurden. Das Sozialministerium, das für die Verteilung von Asylbewerbern auf die Regierungsbezirke zuständig ist, teilt auf SZ-Nachfrage mit, dass im Ministerium nichts darüber bekannt gewesen sei, dass Mostafa K. als allgemeingefährlich galt.Wohl aus Unwissenheit und weil laut Ministerium die Asylunterkünfte knapp gewesen seien, schickte man ihn in die Oberpfalz. Die Unterbringung in der Oberpfalz sei auch auf Wunsch der eigentlich zuständigen Bezirksregierung in Oberbayern erfolgt, teilt die oberpfälzische Bezirksregierung mit. Mostafa K., der vor seiner Haft in München lebte, habe außerhalb Oberbayerns untergebracht werden sollen, um ihn möglichst weit weg zu halten von seiner früheren Frau.Die Personalie Mostafa K. sei der Regierung der Oberpfalz ""aufgrund der kriminalpolizeilichen Sicherheitsbewertung im Hinblick und ausschließlich wegen der ausgesprochenen Bedrohung gegenüber der vormaligen Ehefrau des Täters"" übertragen worden, teilt die Behörde mit. Dass der Afghane vom Verwaltungsgericht als allgemeingefährlich eingeschätzt wurde, war der Bezirksregierung offenbar ebenfalls nicht bekannt. ""Wäre eine Allgemeingefährdung festgestellt worden, hätte der Betroffene zwingend in Sicherungsverwahrung genommen werden müssen"", so die Behörde.Dass die Wahl der Unterbringung letztlich auf Arnschwang fiel, habe auch damit zu tun gehabt, dass Mostafa K. zum Christentum konvertiert war und man ihn deshalb ""in einer nicht überwiegend muslimisch geprägten Unterkunft"" unterbringen wollte. Eine Unterkunft, ""in der ausschließlich Einzelpersonen oder kinderlose Ehepaare untergebracht werden"", gebe es in der Oberpfalz nicht.Nach seiner Haftentlassung 2015 unterzog sich Mostafa K. einer Suchtentwöhnungstherapie und absolvierte ein Anti-Gewalt-Training. Beides war gerichtlich verordnet worden, beides hatte er nach Auskunft der Führungsaufsicht binnen eines halben Jahres erfolgreich beendet. Doch ob diese Maßnahmen adäquat waren, ist zweifelhaft. Auch danach zeigte der Mann ein psychisch auffälliges Verhalten, er unternahm einen Suizidversuch.Wegen anhaltender Depressionen und weil sich Mostafa K. offenbar einsam fühlte, drängte sein Bewährungshelfer darauf, ihn in eine größere Stadt umzuquartieren. Einen entsprechenden Antrag lehnte die Regierung der Oberpfalz ab. Mostafa K. musste in Arnschwang bleiben, wo es dann zur Tragödie kam.",49.274934,12.815369,Arnschwang,Germany,SDZ/RT,http://www.sueddeutsche.de/bayern/oberpfalz-arnschwang-gericht-warnte-vor-mostafa-k-1.3536959,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,4044,Dorien,01-05-2018,New Entry,19/04/2018,Klara

But it’s enough time for officers to saunter through the packed carriages, handpicking anyone they think might be a migrant before escorting them off at the well-manicured seaside resort of Menton-Garavan, the first stop along a route that passes through the wealthy principality of Monaco before arriving in swanky Cannes, and sending them back to Italy.Officers are just as diligent at the entrance of the tunnel pass and along the motorway that connects the two countries, as well as along the so-called “passage of death”, a mountain trail that was used by Italian Jews fleeing the dictator Benito Mussolini’s Fascist regime during the second world war. French police reportedly use drones and dogs to sniff out trespassers, many wearing just flip-flops, making the risky journey.At least 12 migrants have died since last September while trying to slip across the border, either by being hit by vehicles along the motorway or falling to their death from the mountain path.

Zwei Jahre zuvor war er aus Afghanistan nach Deutschland geflüchtet. Sein älterer Bruder hatte dort Schutz gefunden. Aber die Lage hatte sich geändert seither. Farhads Asylantrag wiesen die deutschen Behörden ab. Die EU hatte nämlich mit der korrupten afghanischen Regierung ein Rücknahmeabkommen geschlossen. Einen Teufelspakt. Farhads Vater hatte in der kommunistischen Zeit als Offizier gegen die vom „freien Westen“ hochgerüsteten Islamisten gekämpft. Nach deren Machtergreifung war er in den Iran geflüchtet und später, nach dem vermeintlichen Sturz der Taliban, in seine Heimatregion  Herat zurückgekehrt. Wo die Taliban jetzt wieder auf dem Vormarsch sind. Farhad wurde am 14. Februar 2017 von Deutschland in die afghanische Hauptstadt Kabul deportiert. Dort soll es ja sicherer sein als anderswo in Afghanistan. Obwohl es täglich Bombenanschläge gibt. Farhad kannte niemanden in Kabul. Er konnte keine Arbeit finden. Unzählige junge Männer, Abgeschobene ebenso wie Binnenflüchtlinge, suchen dort vergeblich Arbeit. Sie leben auf der Straße, werden drogensüchtig, manche schaffen es, Dealer zu werden, ein gewaltiger sozialer Aufstieg, andere schließen sich den Terroristen an. Farhad lehnte diese „Alternativen“ ab. Er ging in seine Heimatregion Herat, wo seine alten Eltern leben. Er meldete sich freiwillig als „Dorfschützer“, um die Menschen dieser Gegend gegen die Taliban zu verteidigen. Sein jüngerer Bruder und sein Cousin schlossen sich ihm an. Keiner von ihnen hatte irgendeine militärische Ausbildung. Sie gerieten am 10. Mai 2017 in einen Hinterhalt der Taliban. Farhad und sein Cousin wurden erschossen, sein Bruder überlebte schwer verletzt. Der „freie Westen“ hat Afghanistan längst abgeschrieben, seine Truppen abgezogen. Das Land war wichtig, solange es dem antikommunistischen Kreuzzug diente. Wenn die Islamisten in den 80er-Jahren ein Dorf vom Kommunismus „befreiten“, war der erste, den sie erschossen, der Lehrer. Weil er den Kindern beigebracht hatte, daß Wissen wertvoller als Glauben ist. Den jetzigen Kampf gegen die islamischen Faschisten hat der „freie Westen“ Menschen wie Farhad überlassen.

01/02/2017,in Feb 2017,5,N.N. (teenagers),Afghanistan,committed suicide through January and February 2017 in asylum centres in Sweden,"Sorge wegen Selbstmorden junger AsylbewerberDie Angst vor Abschiebung belastet viele Flüchtlinge - nicht nur in Deutschland. In Schweden haben sich in den vergangenen Wochen fünf afghanische Asylbewerber das Leben genommen. Nach einem Krisentreffen wollen sich Einwanderungsbehörde und Hilfsorganisationen jetzt intensiver um die meist jugendlichen Flüchtlinge kümmern.Von Carsten Schmiester    Viele minderjährige Flüchtlinge in Schweden fühlen sich einsam und haben psychische Probleme. (dpa / picture-alliance / Bernd Wüstneck)Fünf Selbstmorde sind bestätigt, drei davon allein in den vergangenen zwei Wochen. Möglicherweise sind es mehr. Denn es gibt keine genauen Zahlen, weil junge Flüchtlinge in Schweden anfangs keine Personennummer haben, also nicht sofort registriert werden und ihre Namen nicht in Statistiken auftauchen. Unbekannt ist auch die Zahl der Selbstmordversuche. Schweden hat ein großes Problem mit meist minderjährigen Flüchtlingen aus Afghanistan, seit die Regierung im vergangenen Jahr das Asylrecht verschärft und unter anderem Teile des Landes für ""sicher"" erklärt hat. Musse Hossein ist selbst als Minderjähriger allein aus Afghanistan geflohen. Jetzt kümmert er sich um die meist unter 18-Jährigen, die nach ihm gekommen sind – allerdings in ein anderes Schweden.""Diese Menschen sind vor dem Tod geflohen und haben eine furchtbare Reise hinter sich. Sie fühlen sich einsam, haben psychische Probleme. Wenn dann ihr Asylantrag abgelehnt wird, ist die Situation natürlich ernst.""Kaum Reaktionen aus der PolitikEher sogar unerträglich, selbst die Angst vor der Ablehnung und damit vor der möglichen Abschiebung belastet vor allem die Jungen, die alleine geflohen sind und erst einmal niemanden haben, dem sie sich anvertrauen können. Knapp 3.000 minderjährige Afghanen sollen im vergangenen Jahr nach Schweden gekommen sein, etwa 600 von ihnen wurden als Asylbewerber abgelehnt und werden nur geduldet, wenn sie nachweisen  können, dass sie in ihrer Heimat keine Angehörigen mehr haben. ""Vi står inte ut"", ""wir halten das nicht aus"", so heißt ein Hilfsnetzwerk für diese jungen Flüchtlinge. Die Psychologin Julia Tiberg arbeitet dort:""Wir beobachten, dass sich jugendliche Asylsuchende in geschlossenen Internetforen treffen und gegenseitig zum Selbstmord ermutigen. Da geht es um kollektiven Selbstmord oder darum, wie man sich am besten das Leben nimmt, wer es wohl als nächster macht. Selbstmord wird von dieser Gruppe auch als moralisches Handeln für das Wohl der anderen betrachtet, um die aktuelle Politik zu beeinflussen.""Die Politik hat sich bisher kaum um diese Problemgruppe gekümmert. Die Jugendlichen haben nach Angaben von Hilfsorganisationen oft keinen engeren Kontakt zu Erwachsenen und überhaupt wenig Chancen, Beziehungen aufzubauen. Denn sie werden immer wieder umquartiert. Aber jetzt hat sich Ombudsmann Fredrik Malmberg eingeschaltet, der schwedische Kinderbeauftragte.""Ich wurde von der Sozialbehörde darüber informiert, dass es scheinbar organisierte Selbstmordgedanken unter asylsuchenden Jugendlichen ohne Familien gibt. Das ist ausgesprochen besorgniserregend, weil bereits mehrere aus dieser Gruppe tatsächlich Selbstmord begangen haben.""Aufklärungsfilm gegen Selbstmordgedanken Er hat ein Krisentreffen organisiert, dessen Ergebnis allerdings nicht eben auf einen radikalen Wechsel im Umgang mit diesen Jugendlichen hindeutet. So wie ihn unter anderem Musse Hossein fordert, mit besserer Integration gerade junger Flüchtlinge und einer, wie er sagt, ""gerechteren"", aus schwedischer Sicht dann wohl eher großzügigeren Behandlung der Asylanträge. Aber so weit gehen die Empfehlungen des Krisentreffens nicht. Die Jugendlichen sollen künftig lediglich genauer über den Asylprozess informiert, mit ihrer Betreuung beauftragtes Personal soll besser geschult werden. Und es wird einen Suizid-Aufklärungsfilm geben in ihrer Sprache ""Dari"". Damit will man weitere Selbstmorde verhindern.",59.42698,17.926826,,Sweden,DFunk/EpochTimesDE,http://www.deutschlandfunk.de/schweden-sorge-wegen-selbstmorden-junger-asylbewerber.1773.de.html?dram:article_id=379194,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,,,,,,,,,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,,4074,Klara,26/04/2018,New Entry,24/04/2018,Klara

On Sunday, they were transferred to a Norwegian ship of the same mission, the Siem Pilot, provided by the Norwegian coastguard, which brought them to southern Italy.Besides the four survivors, rescuers also recovered 8 corpses in the area. The Siem Pilot arrived in the port of Trapani on Monday evening, also bringing to land another 34 migrants rescued from another stricken migrant boat in a previous operation.The four survivors (two Ethiopian and two Eritreans) reported that several hours passed before rescuers came to save them.

In several phone conversations with the boat-people, our shift team learned that there were 10 people on a black rubber boat that had left from Tangier/Morocco about 2am. They could not specify the exact location of their departure and were also not able to pass on their current GPS position. They informed us that they could still see the port of Tangier, as well as the beach and black and red vessels in the distance. They asked us to inform Salvamento Maritimo, the Spanish search and rescue organisation. We reached out to Salvamento at 8.38am and passed on all the acquire information. They informed us that they were engaged in another Search and Rescue operation and wondered whether this was the boat in question. We let the travellers know that we had informed the Spanish authorities. Afterwards we kept calling the boat but the connection remained bad, with a lot of noise in the background. At 9.44am, Salvamento told us that they were in contact with the boat but not yet able to find them. As of 10.44am, we were unable to reach the boat-people any longer. At 11.30am Salvamento confirmed that they would send out a helicopter to search for the boat. At 1.01pm, Salvamento informed us that they were still in contact with the travellers and trying to find them. They also thought that they were already close to the Spanish coast. In the following hours, our shift team tried repeatedly to call the travellers, without success. In the evening, at 8.25pm, Salvamento informed us that they had unfortunately not been able to find the boat and would re-launch their Search and Rescue operation tomorrow.The next day we learned that Caminando Fronteras knew of 21 people who had disappeared the day before, with two bodies already found on the beaches of Tarifa. The 21 people had presumably left on two boats, one of which had left already on Thursday, and one on Friday. In the afternoon, at 4.30pm, a contact person informed us also about the dead bodies that had been found. He did not have news regarding the boat carrying 10 people.The following days we received further information about the shipwrecks. The boat in question had left on the 13th of January at 3am, carrying 7 men and 3 women, presumably on a boat without engine, just paddles. Apparently when the boat approached Tarifa, two men decided to swim to shore. Their whereabouts are unknown. (( Note: According to the Independent, 2 bodies were found floating near Tarifa; they might be the bodies of these 2 men. Even if they are not, these 2 men would be recorded in the database as missing. ))In bad weather conditions, the boat continued with 8 people on board.

(man),unknown,threw himself into the path of a truck on the French/Italian border near Ventimiglia (IT),"Much like the rest of Italy, Ventimiglia has been left alone to deal with a humanitarian crisis that is growing dramatically and that now threatens to undermine the fragile unity of the EU, which is appearing to ignore the problems faced by its members in the south.There was a time when French police would judiciously patrol the border while on the prowl for shoppers unwittingly transporting counterfeit purchases from the market. But since early 2011, when the migration crisis began in earnest as the Arab spring turned north African societies upside down, they have made the passage impenetrable to those desperately trying to join relatives or seeking a better life in northern Europe.AdvertisementThe patrols were stepped up after 84 people were killed in a terror attack in Nice, the French Riviera city just 39km along the coast, last July.It only takes a few minutes to crawl into France by train from Italy, with the railway track crossing above the migrant camp along the river beneath. But it’s enough time for officers to saunter through the packed carriages, handpicking anyone they think might be a migrant before escorting them off at the well-manicured seaside resort of Menton-Garavan, the first stop along a route that passes through the wealthy principality of Monaco before arriving in swanky Cannes, and sending them back to Italy.Officers are just as diligent at the entrance of the tunnel pass and along the motorway that connects the two countries, as well as along the so-called “passage of death”, a mountain trail that was used by Italian Jews fleeing the dictator Benito Mussolini’s Fascist regime during the second world war. French police reportedly use drones and dogs to sniff out trespassers, many wearing just flip-flops, making the risky journey.At least 12 migrants have died since last September while trying to slip across the border, either by being hit by vehicles along the motorway or falling to their death from the mountain path. Alfatehe Ahmed Bachire, a 17-year-old from Sudan, drowned in June while trying to retrieve a shoe washed away by a strong current as he tried to clean his only pair in the Roia river.“We know that 12 people have died, but the number is probably higher, as there may be more who died in the mountains on the French side,” said Zitarosa.Meanwhile, a man from Afghanistan attempted to kill himself earlier this year after being warned that if he attempted to cross the border again he would be sent back to his European starting point in Italy’s south as part of a containment initiative by the Ventimiglia authorities. Another migrant died after throwing himself into the path of a truck in what is believed to have been suicide.",43.798433,7.586145,Ventimiglia,Italy,Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/22/italy-feels-heat-europe-slams-door-on-migrants,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3945,Klara,19/01/2018,New Entry,19/01/2018,Klara

People for whom finding food and, at times, shelter is a constant struggle,"" the NGOs said. It is clear that there is much more that can be done to ensure that migrants are able to live with dignity and effectively enjoy their rights.The migrants' problems, the NGOs added, were often exacerbated by mental illness or alcohol dependence, which not only made these people more vulnerable to poverty and homelessness, but also made it virtually impossible for them to break out of the destructive cycle of poverty without extensive support.""Although it would be facile to place all of the blame at the door of the state, it is clear that there is much more that can be done to ensure that migrants are able to live with dignity and effectively enjoy their rights.""Migrants, even those such as Haji who were granted protection, are provided with very limited support to rebuild their lives in Malta. Often they must turn to NGOs for help to learn the language, further their education, or to find a job or housing. Those struggling with mental illness or alcohol dependence, who need intensive services and support, are often unable to find it. This, coupled withdifficulties finding work that is not precarious, seasonal or under-paid, and soaring rent prices, makes it increasingly difficult for migrants to live with dignity.""The NGOs issued their statement to mark International Human Rights Day. They urged the government to address the issue of poverty even among the migrant population and to take steps to ensure that individuals living in destitution receive the support that they need to live with dignity.The NGOs who signed the statement were Aditus foundation, African Media Association Malta, Integra Foundation, International Association for Refugees, JRS Malta, Malta Emigrants’ Commission, Migrant Women Association Malta, Migrants’ Network for Equality, People for Change Foundation, Platform of Human Rights Organisations in Malta and SOS Malta.In a separate statement, the Democratic Party said that while much needed significant progress had been made in Civil Rights in Malta, basic human rights for certain sectors of Maltese society were not being protected.It noted that Home Affairs Minister Carmelo Abela recently said that children born in Malta to Eritrean parents will not be sent to Eritrea due to lack of documents in Eritrea. It asked whether these children stateless, adding that if this is the case, then they should be given the citizenship of the country in which they were born, Malta.In the case of the Malians awaiting deportation, the party observed that some have been in Malta for years, worked here and become fully integrated into society.The party said the citizenship question has to be revisited.""A person can live here for years, work legally, pay taxes, rent, national insurance contributions, satisfying all acceptable criteria, and yet, may only be granted citizenship at the relevant minister's discretion. Yet others, without any interest in our country and only to gain a financial advantage, just need to pay a certain amount of money up front in order to be granted a Maltese passport,"" the party observed. ""This system is unjust and elitist where those with money are treated differently from those without.

02/11/2016,02/11/16,128,N.N.,unknown,reportedly missing after rubber dinghy capsized off Libya while travelling to Italy; 2 survivors,"Posted: 11/04/16Region-Country: Europe and Central Asia / SwitzerlandThemes: Humanitarian Emergencies, Missing MigrantsSwitzerland - An estimated 725 more migrants have died in the Mediterranean so far in 2016 compared to the same period (January to 4 November) in 2015. This is after 240 migrants went missing and are presumed dead after two shipwrecks on Wednesday (02/11) in the Mediterranean between Libya and Italy.These latest tragedies bring the grim tally of migrant deaths in 2016 to 4,220, making this already the deadliest year ever recorded. In 2015 some 3,770 migrants and refugees died trying to cross the Mediterranean.The 27 survivors and 12 corpses, among them 3 children, from the first shipwreck, were brought to the island of Lampedusa by two Italian Coast Guard ships. The survivors informed IOM staff that there were also 6 children and 18 women, some of them pregnant, on board. Three survivors were hospitalized with one of them in very bad condition. This shipwreck claimed therefore approximately 113 victims – these include the missing migrants and retrieved corpses.Together with the 27 survivors of this shipwreck, the Italian Coast Guard ships also brought to Lampedusa two other survivors from another shipwreck – two women saved during a second rescue operation. They told IOM staff that this second shipwreck occurred on Wednesday (02/11), around 5 am. The women said they were travelling on a rubber dinghy carrying 130 people and the number of missing migrants is around 128.“The increase in the number of victims compared to last year is linked to two different factors,” said Federico Soda, Director of the IOM’s Coordination Office for the Mediterranean in Rome. “First, there were three large shipwrecks at the end of April and May, which affected hundreds of people who were travelling on three flimsy boats. These caused almost 1,400 deaths. This past month has also been extremely tragic. It claimed the lives of more than 250 people last week and 240 yesterday.”“October is generally a month of bad sea conditions, which inevitably cause more incidents. In Italy, we saw a new record for arrivals in October – 27,388 this year, compared to 8,915 in 2015 and 15,264 in 2014. With a larger number of boats, there is also a higher risk of shipwrecks,” he added.IOM Italy spokesperson Flavio Di Giacomo said the reason for the increase in migrant arrivals in October might be partly explained by the testimony of survivors. “The migrants who reach Italy have been telling us that smugglers have been telling them that the Libyan Coast Guard is being trained to carry out more rescues at sea. In a couple of months migrants who choose to undertake the sea crossing will be more likely to be rescued by the Libyan Coast Guard and brought back to Libya.” Di Giacomo added that although these testimonies need to be verified, many migrants have told IOM that this is why there is a rush to depart now. “Basically migrants do not want to be taken back to Libya, where they risk falling back into the vicious cycle of violence and abuse that they are fleeing.”Although there was a significant peak in migrant arrivals in Italy in October, the overall number of arrivals has only increased by 13 percent compared to last year and is in line with 2014 totals.The range of nationalities has changed, with fewer arrivals from the Horn of Africa and the Middle East. The number of Western Africans nationals has increased.“The migration plans of the West Africans often change as they travel from place to place. There are many who only wanted to migrate to Libya to work, but later attempted the sea crossing to Europe to flee the abuses and violence they experienced there,” Soda said.“Another new trend compared to a couple of years ago is that more migrants who arrive by sea now wish to stay in Italy and do not plan to continue their journey towards Northern Europe,” he noted.Meanwhile IOM reports that 335,031 migrants and refugees entered Europe by sea in 2016 through 2 November, arriving mostly in Greece and Italy. Some 169,901 people have arrived in Greece and 159,496 in Italy during 2016.This overall total of 335,031 migrant arrivals so far, is well below the number of arrivals at this point in 2015. Some 728,926 migrants and refugees made the journey between 1 January and 31 October 2015.In Greece, 96 migrant arrivals by sea were registered on 29 October and 2 November on the Greek islands of Lesvos, Rhodes, Samos and Megisti. ",34.101002,14.622803,Mediterranean Sea,Libya,IOM/ANSA/TheHuff,https://www.iom.int/news/725-more-mediterranean-migrant-deaths-period-last-year,128,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,128,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,128,,,,,,,128,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,128,,,,,,128,,,,,,,,,,,,,3683,Klara,09/06/2017,Entry Nihan,20/02/2017,listofdeathsresearch

04/10/2016,04/10/16,29,"N.N. (19 women, 10 men)",Sub-Saharan Africa,suffocated in a boat carrying over a thousand passengers from Libya to Italy,"It began with blips on a radar screen, 12 miles off the Libyan coast. As the rescuers approached, they found overloaded wooden vessels and rafts that evoked scenes of the slave trade.Hundreds of African migrants were crammed into boats headed for Italy. More than two dozen people were dead in one boat alone, asphyxiated from the crush aboard. In other boats, bodies were splayed on the floorboards, forcing survivors to clamber over the corpses of their fellow voyagers.Aris Messinis, an Agence France-Presse photographer aboard the rescue boat Astral, said it was like nothing he had ever seen.The passengers — from Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia, Nigeria and other sub-Saharan countries — were found by the Astral on Tuesday, part of a wave of more than 11,000 rescued in the Mediterranean by aid groups and the Italian Coast Guard this week.Migrants aboard a large wooden boat, which may have held 1,000 people — roughly five times its capacity — waited frantically for help. Some jumped into the water.Even with life jackets tossed to them, migrants struggled to reach the Astral and other rescue vessels, which later transferred them to Italian Coast Guard ships bound for Italy.Pandemonium punctuated the rescue operation, despite efforts by the Astral crew to calm the migrants. “These people were in panic,” Mr. Messinis said.Migrants aboard the wooden vessel included infants, like the one below.In one of the boats, holding roughly 150 people, Mr. Messinis said that rescuers found 29 bodies — 10 men and 19 women. “They told us these people were dead from the night,” he said.At one point, passengers held a child aloft to signal rescuers of their desperation.Migrants crammed below deck were packed so tightly they struggled to get out. “Many of them haven’t seen the sea in their whole lives,” said Laura Lanuza, a spokeswoman for Proactiva Open Arms, a Spanish aid group that operates the Astral.Despite a drop in sea crossings to Europe by migrants this year, more than 3,000 have died in perilous crossings from Libya, where political chaos has made it the main departure point for smuggling operators who care little about whether their clients survive.Rescue officials attributed the spike in sea crossings in recent days to a stretch of good weather after days of storms and sea turbulence.The wooden vessel’s cargo hold contained two-thirds of the roughly 1,000 people found aboard, Ms. Lanuza said, calling the conditions “just like a slavery boat — the same.”After the living were rescued, Astral crew members put the dead in body bags and stored them in life rafts.Migration officials and rescue groups in Europe say the migrant route from North Africa remains the deadliest. Joel Millman, a spokesman for the International Organization for Migration, said at least 38 migrant bodies were recovered in Mediterranean rescues Monday and Tuesday, including those found by the Astral.Mr. Messinis, 39, who has covered the conflicts in Libya and Syria, has been photographing the European migration crisis since it began three years ago. He has often put aside his camera to help rescuers.What he witnessed on the Mediterranean, he said, was different. The analogy to slave ships that once plied the Atlantic, he said, was “exactly right — except that it’s not hundreds of years ago.”""I’ve seen a lot of death, but not this thing,” he said. “This is shocking and this is what makes you feel you are not living in a civilized world.”--More than 20 migrants are said to have suffocated in the hold of an overloaded boat off the Libyan coast.A photographer who was able to board the stricken wooden vessel said more than 1,000 migrants had been crammed aboard.They were among at least 28 migrants who died in the area on Tuesday, while some 4,655 people were rescued.The total number rescued over the past two days is more than 10,000, while the death toll is at least 50.Smugglers have taken advantage of calm weather to push more boats out to sea.Aris Messinis, a photographer for the French AFP news agency, said many of the dead aboard one particular boat had suffocated.He said: ""It was a wooden vessel and there were about 1,000 people on three levels. I counted 22 bodies and there are still others in the hold.""Mr Messinis's graphic images showed the bodies of dead young men and women, piled on top of one another on the deck of a dinghy and in the cramped hold of a wooden boat.On Monday, 6,055 migrants were rescued - one of the highest numbers in a single day - and 22 found dead, Italian and Libyan officials said. One Italian ship rescued about 725 migrants from a single rubber boat, the coastguard said - just one of 20 rescue operations that day.Relatively calm weather is contributing to a surge in the number of people attempting to make the crossing before the cold weather sets in.The surge takes the number of migrants who have arrived in Italy this year to about 142,000 and the death toll to about 3,100, according to the International Organisation for Migration.The majority come from African countries, including Nigeria, Eritrea, Guinea, Gambia, Sudan, Ivory Coast and Somalia.European law says migrants must stay in the country where they first enter the EU. With fewer migrants able to travel into Europe via Greece and the Balkan route, and France, Switzerland and Austria effectively closing their borders, Italy is struggling to deal with the growing numbers landing on its shores.Monday marked three years to the day since 366 migrants died when an overcrowded boat sank off the Italian coast, in a disaster that first drew widespread attention to the plight of those attempting to reach Europe by sea.",33.92513,14.370117,Mediterranean Sea,Libya,NYTimes/BBC/DailySabah,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/06/world/europe/migrants-mediterranean.html,29,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,29,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,29,,,,,,,,,,,,,,29,,,,,,,,,,,,,29,,,,,,29,,,,,,,,,,,,,3354,Klara,07/06/2017,New Entry,16/02/2017,Klara

16/09/2016,16/09/16,1,"Raheemullah Oryakhel (14, boy)",Afghanistan,hit by car near Calais (FR) when he fell off lorry he had climbed on to get to Great Britain,"additional links:http://www.lavoixdunord.fr/45556/article/2016-09-16/un-migrant-meurt-percute-par-un-vehicule-sur-la-rocade-portuaireThe death of Raheemullah Oryakhel, a 14-year-boy from Afghanistan, was marked last month with just a couple of paragraphs in the French press, under the headline “One migrant dead on the port ring road”. There was nothing much to excite further interest; the boy was the 12th refugee to die in Calais this year. The news item added that Raheemullah’s body had been found on the N216, on a stretch of motorway where a number of migrants had previously been run over. Police said he had probably been hit by a car. Whoever was behind the wheel had not bothered to stop.Nor are the details of Raheemullah’s death particularly shocking to the handful of relatives and acquaintances he left behind in the Calais camp, a fetid, cramped cluster of sagging donated tents and roughly built wooden shacks, now home to an estimated 9,000 asylum seekers. The idea that vulnerable children, some as young as eight, who have mostly fled conflict zones, should spend night after night trying to leap on to moving vehicles, in a desperate (and mostly futile) attempt to reach the UK, surprises no one. It’s a risky business. Sometimes people get suffocated in the trucks, or frozen in refrigerated containers; sometimes they choose a different route and drown trying to swim to England or get electrocuted on the railway. And sometimes they just get run over.The stories you need to read, in one handy email Read moreBut there is sadness and some bitterness at the driver’s failure to stop, and at the apparently cursory nature of the police investigation. Abdul Wali, an older camp resident who helped raise more than €4,000 (£3,516) to send Raheemullah’s body back to his parents, says, “Even in Afghanistan, if someone is hit by a car, at least the driver will take him to a police station or hospital and say sorry. Here, people are dying and no one cares.”Raheemullah is probably the youngest asylum seeker to die yet, but his death epitomises the risks that hundreds are taking every night on the roads outside Calais. As the French government prepares to dismantle the camp next week, aiming to disperse its residents around the country instead, the sense of urgency surrounding the mission to get to the UK has intensified. It is an intolerable situation for everyone involved: the lorry drivers, Calais residents, local police (who are exhausted by nightly patrols) and, most of all, for the camp’s population.The last person to see Raheemullah alive was almost certainly his friend Karim, also 14, who was trying to pull him on to the top of a moving lorry shortly before dawn on Friday 16 September. “I was saying, ‘Give me your hand’ but he didn’t,” Karim says. “He didn’t listen.” It was a terrifying few minutes, in total darkness. One second his friend was there, the next he was gone.Until recently, Karim (an assumed name to avoid anything that might complicate his asylum claim, should he ever be in a position to make one) was showing anyone he met a photograph of his dead friend, taken in the Lille morgue, looking as bad as you might expect after a fatal road accident. Volunteers who have stepped in to help with the hundreds of children at the camp have since persuaded him to delete the image from his phone. They know Karim is devastated, but have little at their disposal to cheer him up. One volunteer took him out of the camp for an ice-cream; another took him to the donations warehouse and got him a new pair of socks.Two weeks after the accident, Karim sits on a wooden pallet at the edge of the camp and explains how he and Raheemullah came to be on the motorway before dawn that night. The two boys had walked for an hour along the high barbed-wire fencing that separates the camp from the road, to a spot where other asylum seekers had dragged some wooden logs into the centre of the road, forcing lorries to slow down.Sometimes there are 100 people by the road, trying to get into the lorries. Someone is going to fall over and get hitBoth had made frequent night-time attempts to get to England together. Karim has been in the camp since January, trying most nights to make his way across the Channel. Raheemullah, who came from the same part of Afghanistan, arrived in July, and the two became friends. Most evenings they played cricket and volleyball on the wasteland beside the motorway. “He was a good friend,” Karim says. “I liked him very much.”They found a crowd of people hoping to push their way on to the stream of heavy goods vehicles as they slowed to navigate the obstacles. Karim and Raheemullah followed two older men, climbing on to the axle between the driver’s cab and the container section of the lorry. Karim managed to get on to the top of the container, but Raheemullah was still on the ledge between the cab and the rest of the truck when it began to gather speed. Karim says the lorry started swerving abruptly, as if trying to shake off the uninvited passengers. He leaned over the edge, offering his friend his hand. “Why didn’t he take it?” he asks.No one knows quite what happened next. One of the older men cut a small hole in the roof of the truck (a black vehicle with an enormous red logo on the side, Karim says). Karim lowered himself through it into the container, which held a consignment of swivelling office chairs, and hid there as the truck continued to the port. Some time later, he was discovered by port officials before the truck drove on to the ferry. When he returned to the camp, he discovered his friend was missing.Raheemullah lived in the camp in a windowless chipboard hut with his first cousin, Wahid, 23, and two other men. No one has moved his belongings, a few clothes stored in plastic bags. The grubby brown blanket and mattress where he slept for the last two and a half months of his life are still there.Wahid is better able to articulate the loss and anger he feels about his cousin’s death. He speaks good English, having spent three years at secondary school in Norwich, after fleeing the Taliban when he was 14. He was taken in by a foster family, made friends, studied hard, took a part-time job in a Chinese takeaway – and then, at 17 and a half, his case was reconsidered and he was told he would be deported back to Afghanistan, which the Home Office categorises as a safe destination. He spent some time trying to appeal, but left for Europe rather than be sent back. There are many young Afghan men, with fluent English, in a similar situation in Calais.Wahid’s friend Abdul went to school in Birmingham (also after being threatened by the Taliban), before being told at 17 that he was no longer eligible to remain in England. Both hope to return to the UK, which is the place they consider home, to appeal for leave to stay.Wahid was shocked to see his cousin, whom he had not seen since he was a child, arrive in the camp. While ambivalent about Raheemullah’s determination to get to England, given his own mixed experiences, Wahid didn’t try to dissuade him. “It was not my job to tell him how to decide his life.” Instead, he invited him to come and share his hut. Raheemullah had travelled alone from Afghanistan, and been badly beaten by Bulgarian police; he was relieved to find someone to protect him. For a month, they went out together five nights a week, to try to jump on a lorry.“In the beginning he was happy,” Wahid says. “He said it was good fun. Slowly he realised it was not easy, that it was risky. Sometimes I’d say, let’s go tonight, and he’d say, ‘No, tomorrow.’ I knew he didn’t want to go. He was very scared. It’s a one-hour walk in the dark. You feel scared of the French people. You worry that if they see you alone, maybe they will beat you. Sometimes there are 100 people by the road, trying to get into the lorries. People are pushing. Of course someone is going to fall over and get hit.”I said, ‘The sooner you can go from here, the better.’ There is fighting. It is not a good place for a childWahid was also aware the camp wasn’t a safe place for Raheemullah. “That’s why I said, ‘The sooner you can go from here, the better.’ There is fighting between the Sudanese and the Afghans, between the Afghans and the Afghans – for no reason, just because of the tension here. It gets boring. You sleep, wake up, sleep, wake up. You can’t shower for a week. People are desperate. It is not a good place for anyone, especially not a child.”He feels anger at how slow the British response has been. Raheemullah had an older brother in Manchester, and was in theory eligible to join him in the UK; but the process for organising reunification is very slow, bureaucratic and hard to understand. It is not clear how much his brother was able to help with the application, or if the papers had even been lodged. Charities estimate there are 300 to 400 unaccompanied children in Calais with relatives in the UK; but even in straightforward cases, the legal process takes between five and 10 months, during which time the children often give up waiting and start making the nightly journey to the motorway instead.Security has been increased around the port, so that finding a way in has become harder and much more dangerous. Work has recently begun on a £1.9m, 1km-long wall to block off the dual carriageway, half-funded by the UK. Although French president François Hollande has committed to clearing the camp by the end of the year, there is scepticism about how easy it will be to find homes for everyone. Officials believe that people will stay on, and the barriers will still be needed. “Why are you spending the money on building a wall?” Abdul wonders, sitting with Wahid in a caravan that serves as a clothes distribution point, donated tracksuits piled up on the surfaces. “You are wasting money. If they hadn’t built these fences, people wouldn’t risk their lives.”Wahid and Raheemullah managed to get on lorries together three times, but each time were pulled off at the border by officials with sniffer dogs. “The police were nice with him. And, because of him, they were nice with me as well. They take you to the front of the port and say, ‘Go back to the jungle.’” Early last month, Wahid hurt his back badly after his friends put a heavy box over him to hide him inside a lorry. “I was under it for eight hours. I couldn’t stand [it] any more, so I left.”When Raheemullah suggested he come with him early on the morning of 16 September, Wahid said no: his back was too painful. “I told him to be careful. He knew it was very dangerous.” The next morning, when it became obvious Raheemullah was missing, a youth worker from the camp visited local hospitals and police stations to look for him. Later, Wahid went to the morgue to identify the body. Raheemullah’s face was so badly damaged, he was unrecognisable, except for his clothes and a distinctive mark on his arm. Wahid thinks his cousin wasn’t strong enough to pull himself up on to the roof. “He was young, he had no muscles.”Wahid spoke to his uncle, Raheemullah’s father, in Afghanistan, but found himself unable to break the news. “They asked what happened, and I said, ‘He is injured.’ I told them a lie. His parents are quite old. I didn’t want to hurt them.” He assumes their older son called later, from Manchester, to tell them. Since the body arrived back in Afghanistan, accompanied by another relative who came from Norway to travel with the coffin, Raheemullah’s parents have called again to ask how their son died. The calls are distressing: “They keep ringing me. I say, ‘You don’t need to know. He is dead.’ Why make them more upset?”It is still unclear why Raheemullah’s parents sent their son 4,000 miles across Europe to try to start a new life in England. Wahid isn’t forthcoming; his own experiences of hostile questioning by the Home Office have made him wary of the question and he will say only that “it wasn’t an economic problem. There was a danger for him.” But Karim thinks the absence of work in postwar Afghanistan was a factor. “He was going to send money to his family. His father was an old man – he couldn’t work. No one wants to go to England, but if they have problems at home, that’s why they go.”Whatever the reason, the decision to send a child away is never taken lightly, Wahid says. “Of course they will be wishing with their hearts now that they hadn’t. They didn’t know he was going to die.” His own advice to other parents now is not to send their children to Europe, but there is often a reluctance to listen. On the whole, children do not tell their parents about the difficulties they have encountered, so an unrealistic perception prevails. “Life [in Afghanistan] is very hard. There’s Isis and the Taliban, and no security. They don’t know anything about the situation in Calais. The parents don’t know about the risks.” Abdul has become equally firm. “I have five brothers. They call me and ask, shall we come? I say, if you come, you will sleep in the street. Please don’t waste your time.”Volunteers attempt to persuade refugees to claim asylum in France, rather than wasting months and risking their lives trying to get to the UK. They point out that – particularly for young people from Afghanistan – it makes more sense to remain in France, because there is less risk of being deported when they approach 18. But it is hard to persuade children whose parents have paid large sums of money to dispatch them across Europe. People smugglers operating in the camp also have a vested interest in encouraging others to get to the UK, otherwise their business model disappears.Increasing numbers of camp residents have applied for asylum in France; it is now largely those with relatives in the UK who persist in their attempts to join them. But many of those children who decide to stay in France are told there is no room for them in the nearby emergency shelter, which is turning away between 15 and 35 children a day, so they remain in a dangerous limbo. No one knows where the children will be sent once the camp is shut down.Wahid believes any investigation into his cousin’s death has already been closed. No one has come to look for witnesses in the camp. He made one visit to the police station when he was searching for Raheemullah, where he says the police officer was rude; he is reluctant to go again because of his illegal status in France. “They don’t care who has died. To them, we’re just illegal migrants, ‘jungly people’.” The prosecutor’s office of Boulogne-sur-Mer did not respond to emailed requests for details of the police investigation.Meanwhile, a minute’s silence was held for Raheemullah in the camp at the end of September. Friends who spent time with him in the Kids’ Cafe, a wooden hut serving free food to unaccompanied children, say he was shyer than most. Mary Jones, an English volunteer who runs the cafe, describes him as “very quiet and polite”. He attended some of the English lessons given by volunteers, who remember him as “reserved, in a well-brought up way” and “very determined in everything he did, especially learning English”.If Raheemullah’s death failed to register more widely in France, it has had a quiet but significant impact in the UK – both positive and negative. Some of the news reporting prompted delight among the more extreme anti-immigration voices on Twitter (even to hardened eyes, to respond to this death by typing tweets such as “Can’t they show it happening I would enjoy watching it one less to worry about” goes beyond the normal parameters of nastiness).As the demolition date approaches, concern about the fate of unaccompanied children is risingMore constructive was the decision by a group of Conservative MPs to write to home secretary Amber Rudd, calling on her to do more to help reunite children such as Raheemullah with their families. The letter, signed by former education secretary Nicky Morgan and nine others, told Rudd that Raheemullah had “a legal right to be with his brother” but that, “having waited for months in wretched conditions”, he “took fate into his own hands with devastating consequences”.It was discussed at last month’s Labour party conference, too, by Alf Dubs, the kindertransport child refugee and Labour peer, who in May forced the government to accept an amendment to the Immigration Act, agreeing to give homes to some of the estimated 88,000 unaccompanied asylum seekers in Europe. Since his amendment was passed, none of the qualifying children has arrived in the UK. At a conference fringe meeting, Dubs dropped his determination to be politely cooperative with the government, describing them as “bloody liars” for failing to act.As the demolition date approaches, concern about the fate of unaccompanied children is rising, but a solution has yet to be found. Last time French police attempted to demolish the camp, 129 children went missing, according to Help Refugees. Karim has promised volunteers that he won’t try climbing on lorries again, but they suspect he is still going every night anyway.On Monday, Rudd told parliament that she wanted to speed up the transfer of those children with family in the UK, and that Britain would help to fund a shelter in France for children whose cases needed longer consideration. She promised to cut the bureaucracy involved, but there were no details of how many children would be given sanctuary here, and when they could arrive.Meanwhile, the bald list of “registered migrant deaths” compiled by the local police grows longer, with a 13th death in late September and a 14th death last Sunday. This year’s toll includes: “a migrant whose sex could not be identified at the time of the discovery of the body, found drowned in Calais port”; “an Afghan migrant, 22 years, hit by an HGV on the A16 just before 6am”; “body of a migrant found dead around 7am near the port bypass – injuries suggest this migrant was hit by a vehicle”; “a Sudanese migrant, 30 years, hit by a freight train on the railway, close to the port bypass”; “a migrant of unknown nationality on the A16 at the A47 interchange. No witness.” Raheemullah’s death is there, recorded succinctly: “Around 5:30am, the lifeless body of a migrant found on the port ring road.”--On 16 September 2016, a 14-year old Afghan boy was killed while trying to jump onto a lorry in an attempt to travel clandestinely to the UK where he has a brother and two uncles....According to the NGO Help Refugees which provide assistance to the migrants in Calais, the dead boy had been ‘’waiting so long that he lost faith in the system and thought that his only option was to risk his life in order to finally reach safety’’. He is the youngest asylum-seeker to die in an attempt to reach the UK even though he was included in the charity Citizen UK’s Safe Passage programme operated by a legal team helping reunite refugee children with their families in the UK. According to witnesses, the boy had managed to climb onto the back of a lorry whose driver swerved to try and get him off. He then fell and was hit by a passing car, and both vehicles did not bother to stop to see whether they could provide any assistance.It may be pointed out that there is no much sympathy among motorists and lorry drivers making use of the route through Calais to go to the UK on account of the often violent means used by migrants/asylum-seekers to sneak into their vehicles.",50.97028,1.878607,Calais,France,Guardian Un./VoixDuNord/MNS,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/15/very-scared-death-teenage-stowaway,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,3690,Klara,09/06/2017,Entry Nihan,27/02/2017,listofdeathsresearch

The factory worker, who had been living in England for the last four years, was knocked unconscious outside a row of takeaway shops on Saturday and later died in hospital.additional links:http://www.plenglish.com/index.php?o=rn&id=3190&SEO=british-teens-arrested-over-death-of-a-migrantEssex police, who were called to the scene shortly after 11.35pm on Saturday, said the attack on Jóźwik and a second Polish man who survived the assault was apparently unprovoked and that one line of inquiry was the possibility of it being a hate crime.During an emotional visit on Tuesday to the scene of the attack, Jóźwik’s brother, Radek, spoke of how there had been a surge in hatred towards eastern Europeans after Britain’s vote to leave the European Union. He said he been told by police that the attack happened after they heard him and his friends speaking the Polish language.“He was standing eating pizza and they picked on him because of that. He does not speak much English. The young teenagers are so aggressive.“Parents need to speak with their children – they are out of control. One of the teenagers started and then seconds later there are 10 or 12 people attacking him.“After the Brexit vote it has got worse – I have seen people change – it is hard at the moment.”Four 15-year-old boys and one 16-year-old boy, all from Harlow, were arrested on Monday on suspicion of attempted murder and then arrested on suspicion of murder. All five have been bailed until 7 October pending further inquiries. A sixth boy, a 15-year-old from Harlow, was arrested on Tuesday afternoon on suspicion of murder and is awaiting questioning.The attack took place outside some shops in an area of Harlow known as The Stow. Jóźwik suffered head injuries and was taken to the Princess Alexandra hospital in Harlow. He was later transferred to Addenbrooke’s hospital in Cambridge, where he died on Monday.The 43-year-old man who was attacked at the same time was treated in hospital for suspected fractures to his hands and bruising to his stomach.The senior investigating officer, DI Al Pitcher, of the Kent and Essex serious crime directorate, said: “This is now a murder investigation and our inquiries have quickly led to the arrest of five teenage boys. Following this vicious attack, a man has sadly lost his life and I urge anyone with information to contact us as soon as possible.”Police will be carrying out extra patrols in the area to provide reassurance to the community.Some local people who declined to give their name sought to play down allegations of hate crime. “There has been a problem for a while now of young people gathering here and staying late. I find it intimidating to walk past them, and I’m saying that even as a teacher,” said one woman.“There has been a group gathering here for some time on a regular basis and just recently I’ve seen some new faces, which have made it a bit different. Where are the parents of these young people and do they know where their children are at this time of night?”Some residents have said the attack was not the first instance of physical violence against Polish people in Harlow since the Brexit vote.Polish journalists said that they had spoken to a number of people who said two Polish men were taken to hospital several weeks ago following an attack in a street near to where Jóźwik was assaulted.There has been a rise in hate crimes following the vote on 23 June. More than 3,000 allegations of hate crimes were made to UK police, mainly in the form of harassment and threats, in the week before and the week after the vote, a year-on-year increase of 42%.A UN organisation said last week that British politicians had helped fuel a steep rise in racist hate crimes during and after the referendum campaign. The committee on the elimination of racial discrimination said many prominent politicians should share the blame for the outbreak of xenophobia and intimidation against ethnic minorities.Jóźwik’s brother said their mother, who lives in the UK, had come back from holiday to the news of her son’s death. “We had to meet her at Stansted airport and tell her and then take her straight to the hospital. She is really struggling,” he said.“Arek came down to get a pizza – it was the first time he came down to get one. Normally he would get it delivered but for whatever reason he came to buy one and that’s when all the trouble started.”Radek said he had lived in Harlow for the past 12 years and that the killing would not force him to leave the country he now regards as home. “I had said to him, ‘Come on Arek, come over, I will help you find a job. He wanted to stay here.“We will not leave because of his though. I have two children and we have British passports. This is my home.”Polish people who spoke to the Guardian on Tuesday night at the scene of the attack said tensions had been building in the town since the Brexit vote.One man, who worked with Jóźwik, said he and others had increasingly been on the receiving end of abuse from some residents.“I’m not afraid of these people though,” said one young man. “I won’t be going home. I can defend myself.”He said a tearful minute’s silence had been observed at their workplace earlier in the day.“Since the vote, people have been saying things to us for some time.

Il était régulièrement pris à partie dans la rue et voulait quitter Istanbul.

Sur le pont avant de l’Aquarius, Erna Rijnierse, le docteur de Médecins sans frontières, remplit son devoir. C’est elle qui a constaté les décès ; elle qui s’occupe un à un des corps des 21 femmes et de l’homme morts au fond d’un canot qui voguait vers l’Europe. Ces filles s’appelaient Mama, Blexi, Paulina, Younis ou Daxi. Elles n’avaient pas 30 ans, et leur voyage a pris fin mercredi 20 juillet.Après avoir recueilli les 209 vivants répartis sur deux canots pneumatiques, les sauveteurs de l’association humanitaire SOS Méditerranée, aidés de l’équipage de l’Aquarius ont extrait un à un les cadavres baignant dans 40 centimètres d’un mélange d’eau et d’essence, pour les rapatrier dans la chambre mortuaire du bateau.Eric, un jeune Nigérian de 34 ans, ignore ce qui se passe à l’avant du bateau. Lui ne voit plus rien autour de lui. Sur le pont arrière de l’Aquarius, il reste prostré. Cet électricien de Benin City, au Nigeria, voulait offrir une nouvelle vie pleine de rêve à Daxi, son épouse.La Libye n’avait pas été facile pour eux, mais jamais il n’aurait cru que la Méditerranée serait aussi impitoyable. Pourtant, ses espoirs se sont brisés dans un canot, aux premières lueurs du jour. « Je ne peux pas y croire… Je ne sais même pas comment elle est morte. Je n’étais pas à côté d’elle. Je n’ai rien vu. Elle n’avait que 28 ans », souffle-t-il, recroquevillé.Nuit infernaleCe même sentiment plane sur tout l’Aquarius, ce bateau affrété par SOS Méditerranée pour assurer le secours des migrants au large de la Libye. Dans la clinique d’Angelina Perri, la sage-femme, les larmes coulent sans fin, parce qu’il est enfin possible à ces femmes de pleurer. Regroupées par deux ou trois, elles partagent le malheur d’une voisine, d’une amie, se serrent dans les bras, pour se sentir en vie.Lire aussi :   « Mauvais, mauvais » ou « angoisse absolue », typologie des embarcations sauvées par l’« Aquarius »Le groupe des jeunes Nigérianes est particulièrement touché. Aucune ne sait combien d’entre elles manquent à l’appel. Elles espéraient encore, mercredi soir, que certaines absentes soient montées sur un autre canot au départ de la plage libyenne. « J’ai vu certains visages baignant dans l’eau du canot, mais pour d’autres, je ne sais plus vraiment si je les ai vues mortes ou pas », confie Ellen.Dans les canots, les femmes sont toujours installées au milieu, alors que les hommes sont sur les bords extérieurs. Cet espace central, sans doute censé les protéger, fait en réalité d’elles les premières victimes des étouffements et des brûlures causées par le mélange d’essence et d’eau de mer. C’est elles qui sont piétinées en cas de mouvements et noyées en cas de montées d’avanies. Surtout si l’essence leur a tourné la tête ou les a rendues semi-conscientes.Sur le pont arrière, lundi à l’heure du crépuscule, l’odeur d’essence restait prégnante malgré le passage à la douche et les changements de vêtements d’une bonne centaine de personnes. En attendant son tour pour le lavage, Ousmane, 30 ans, originaire du Burkina Faso, se remémorait cette nuit infernale. « J’ai tiré trois filles par les épaules qui étaient près de moi et allaient se noyer dans le mélange toxique. Pour les autres, je n’ai rien pu faire », confie-t-il.En fait, leur voyage avait commencé sans encombre. Il était environ minuit quand leur canot a pris la mer, en même temps que d’autres embarcations. La pleine lune et la houle légère ont permis un début de voyage « normal ».C’est vers 4 ou 5 heures du matin, que la panique s’est installée à bord. « Notre bateau était percé dessous, l’eau a commencé à monter, le plancher s’est relevé, alors les gens ont paniqué. Ils ont essayé de bouger mais c’était impossible, vu le nombre de personnes présentes. Des filles qui étaient assises au milieu se sont trouvées prisonnières et ont été écrasées ou noyées dans l’eau mélangée à beaucoup d’essence renversée », raconte Ousmane.« A l’embarquement, deux d’entre elles étaient déjà très faibles. Elles ont été amenées là, mais toussaient tellement qu’elles n’ont pas supporté les premières vapeurs d’essence », complète Yacoub, 20 ans, l’ami d’Ousmane. Le jeune homme aimerait bien trouver des explications logiques à la mort de ces jeunes femmes. Dans le fond, il sait sûrement, comme le rappelle Ousmane, que « cette nuit, la peur de mourir a transformé chacun de nous en un guerrier qui lutte pour sa survie. Les gens hurlaient, priaient et tous ne pensaient qu’à sauver leur peau ».Lire aussi :   Sur l’Aquarius, tous les métiers mènent au sauvetageUn appel de détresse pour deux cents migrantsCe 20 juillet, la mort s’est invitée sur l’Aquarius alors que le navire devait quitter sa zone de recherche, à 10 heures, pour rentrer vers un port sicilien, après trois semaines de patrouilles au nord de Tripoli. Dix minutes après que le capitaine eut annoncé au centre de contrôle maritime de Rome qu’il désertait sa zone de recherche, pour changer une partie de l’équipage et se ravitailler, le centre opérationnel lui a demandé de se charger d’un appel de détresse « concernant quelque 200 migrants ». Il s’agissait des deux canots pneumatiques qui naviguaient de conserve. L’un déjà transformé en cercueil flottant à cette heure-là ; l’autre, ne transportant que des vivants, à transborder au plus vite.Le capitaine de l’Aquarius, Alexander Moroz, s’est immédiatement dirigé vers la zone concernée, en même temps qu’un navire de la marine italienne, plus rapide. « Les militaires sont venus près de nous, ont constaté qu’il y avait des morts et emmené une femme qui respirait encore pour l’évacuer par hélicoptère vers un hôpital », raconte Ousmane. En attendant l’arrivée de l’Aquarius, les soldats ont ensuite maintenu le lien avec les deux canots et distribué des gilets de sauvetage.Lire aussi :   Sur l’« Aquarius », des femmes intoxiquées et un homme à la merA 13 h 25, les premiers rescapés montaient l’échelle de l’Aquarius, titubant. Certains se sont écroulés sur le pont quand d’autres, totalement intoxiqués, tenaient des propos incohérents. La file devant les trois douches du pont s’est vite allongée, tant le fuel imprégnait les vêtements de ces exilés venus majoritairement du Nigeria (83), de Guinée (62), du Ghana (14), de la Côte d’Ivoire (13), du Mali (13). La plupart n’avaient pas mangé ni bu depuis longtemps, ce qui ajoutait encore à leur état de faiblesse.Deux heures plus tard, l’équipage de l’Aquarius et l’équipe des sauveteurs ont rapatrié les cadavres ; opération qui a pris fin à 18 heures, avant que les coups de couteau finaux ne soient donnés aux deux canots. Tragique, ce dernier sauvetage des dix-huit jours de présence du Monde à bord de ce navire financé par les dons du public résume, à lui seul, le malheur qui se joue au quotidien sur la Mer Méditerranée.",35.411158,17.457275,Mediterranean Sea,Libya,Le Monde,http://www.lemonde.fr/a-bord-de-l-aquarius/article/2016/07/20/vingt-deux-migrants-retrouves-morts-dans-un-canot-en-mediterranee_4972488_4961323.html,22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,22,,,,,,,22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,22,,,,,,22,,,,,,,,,,,,,3715,Klara,18/10/2017,Entry Nihan,01/03/2017,listofdeathsresearch

Boat 3 with about 130 people on board was rescued by the Italian coastguard and boat 4 was rescued by merchant vessels and Frontex forces and brought to Italy. Case 1: At 5.33am we received a direct call from a Thuraya satellite phone. The connection was problematic and all we could here that they were about 140 people and had left 7 hours earlier. Then the line got interrupted and until about 45 minutes later we were unable to re-establish communications. We re-charged their satellite phone and despite not having exact coordinates, we passed on the information we had to the Italian coastguards at 6.12am. At about 6.15am, the boat-people called again and tried, unsuccessfully, to pass on their GPS position. At 6.39am, they were able to send us their GPS position which we forwarded to the Italian coastguard at 6.44am. For several hours afterwards, we could not re-establish contact to the boat. We were then informed that MSF’s rescue vessel Dignity I was on its way to the boat-people. At 2.53pm MRCC Rome confirmed that the group had been rescued by Dignity I, 133 people were rescued but help came too late for one person, who had died. ",35.321568,18.885498,Mediterranean Sea,Italy,WatchTheMed,http://watchthemed.net/index.php/reports/view/524,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,3719,Geert,07/06/2017,Entry Nihan,02/03/2017,listofdeathsresearch

She added: “There is also an alarming trend of violent deaths for migrants in North Africa, with dozens of cases of physical and sexual abuse of migrants directly leading to their death. It is likely that many more cases go unrecorded.” The 34 victims this week were reported to have died in Niger, after being abandoned by their smuggler. These are the only deaths recorded by IOM in Niger, where IOM's Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) operations estimate the passage this year of at least 120,000 migrants since January. Temperatures along migration routes through the Sahara frequently reach well above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit), and this most recent incident indicates that smuggling practices can be extremely deadly for migrants. The dangers of the heavily used route through the Sahara indicate that these deaths may be only a fraction of the true number of migrant fatalities across North Africa. In addition to this week’s tragedy, the Missing Migrants Project estimates 85 of the 342 deaths in North Africa this year were of migrants headed to Spain’s Canarias archipelago off the coast of Morocco. It is likely that many go missing and are unreported on this oversea route, as well, “as it is a very long distance to travel to a very small group of islands,” Black explained. Missing Migrants Project also has recorded 80 deaths in the Horn of Africa this year; 60 of those were drownings in the Straits of Yemen, a sea route many Somalis, Eritreans, and Ethiopians travel to reach the Arabian Peninsula. The remaining 21 deaths were recorded on land, as migrants travelled towards Sudan. Almost half of these were violent deaths, many at the hands of migrant smugglers. The mixed nature of flows through this region means that the precise numbers of migrant deaths are, again, underreported. Indeed, security officials in Djibouti – which hosts the principal land route connecting Ethiopia to the Straits of Yemen – told an IOM delegation earlier this year that sea deaths may account for around 25 percent of migrant fatalities in their country, with the vast majority occurring either from dehydration or vehicular accidents long before many migrants reach the coast.In Sub-Saharan Africa (i.e., Western, Central, Eastern and Southern Africa excluding the Horn), Missing Migrants Project data is very sparse. Nonetheless, IOM has recorded 49 deaths in this region so far during 2016 – an average of more than two per week. Of these, 20 were Somali migrants who were discovered Wednesday after suffocating in the cargo bay of a truck in Zambia.In nearly 18 months since the start of 2015, IOM’s Missing Migrants Project has recorded 678 deaths of migrants across the African continent – Horn of Africa: 176; North Africa: 407; Western, Central and Southern Africa: 95, with 70 of those deaths occurring just in the past two weeks.“These tragedies are in addition to the thousands of Africans who have died after successfully arriving at one of the many coastal launching zones, yet who fail to reach their destinations,” Black said.Giuseppe Loprete, Chief of Mission for IOM Niger, this week said the deaths reported were of the 34 migrants found near the city of Arlit, a desert crossroads near Niger’s border with Algeria. He noted the discovery that most of the 34 victims were women or children which indicates that these are migrants from villages in southern Niger. “Women and children among the migrant group almost always mean migrants bound for Algeria,” Loprete explained.A total of 20 were children under the age of 18, as well as nine adult females and five adult males, the IOM Niger chief added.He said the cost of travel on this route – about USD 300-500 per person – runs about half the cost migrants currently are being charged to reach Libya from Niger. The Algeria route attracts poorer migrants, Loprete explained, migrants who may be exploited and forced into the sex trade and begging (especially minors) once they reach their destination. He added this route also may be even more dangerous than the path to Libya.“Many more die that are not even reported,” Loprete said.",18.929508,7.058716,Arlit,Niger,EinNews/AfricanPO/AFP/France24/IOM,http://www.einnews.com/pr_news/331408209/niger-deaths-add-to-growing-toll-of-migrant-fatalities-within-africa,34,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,34,,,,,,34,,,,,,,,,34,,,,,,,,,,,,,,34,,,,,,,,34,,,,,,,,,,,3727,Dorien,24-04-2018,Entry Nihan,02/03/2017,listofdeathsresearch

01/06/2016,01/06/16,1,"Farhan al-Hwaish (22, man)",Syria,"died in Tisza River (H) after being attacked by police, trying to enter Hungary from Serbia","Hungarian prosecutors have opened an investigation into whether police can be held criminally responsible for abuse over the death of a Syrian migrant who drowned in the Tisza river as he was trying to cross into Hungary from Serbia this month.Farhan al-Hwaish, 22, drowned in a branch of the river on June 1 when a group of migrants tried to cross into Hungary with the help of human traffickers. Police found his body two days later.His brother, who crossed with him, says he drowned after Hungarian police guarding the border on the river bank threw objects at them, sprayed them with gas and unleashed attack dogs to prevent them from climbing out of the water.The police deny any such mistreatment.""This allegation is entirely unfounded,"" Hungary's Csonograd county police force said in an emailed response to Reuters on Tuesday, which said police rescued an Iraqi family of five from the river that day.""Police conduct duties in a lawful, professional and proportionate manner, paying special attention to a humane treatment towards illegal immigrants, respecting their human dignity.""It noted that an autopsy on the body had concluded the death was caused by drowning, and that the body showed no injuries.Hungary's prosecutors' office said in an emailed reply to questions from Reuters that it had ordered an investigation five days after the incident. The case would look into ""suspicion of ill-treatment committed during an official procedure"" by an ""unknown perpetrator"", it said, giving no identification of any officers involved.""During the investigation we will examine what happened, and whether any of the police who were on duty on the given stretch of the border can be held criminally responsible,"" Andrea Nagy, a spokeswoman for the prosecutor's office said.The incident is believed to be the first in which Hungarian police have been investigated over allegations they badly mistreated migrants at the EU's external frontier. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees has called for an investigation. [L8N18Y2G2]Hungary's southern border was the main entry point for hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees and other migrants traveling over land across the Balkans into the EU's border-free Schengen zone, until the Hungarian authorities abruptly shut the frontier last year.Hungary swiftly built a razor wire fence and fortified it with police and army patrols. Its hard line at the border has since drawn criticism from rights groups, but Hungary says the law requires it to prevent unauthorized entry into the Schengen zone, and that most refugees or other migrants are safe in Serbia.GO BACK! SWIM! SWIM!According to the initial account of the incident reported on the national police website, a river patrol spotted two people at 5:55 a.m. on June 1 swimming across a branch of the river that forms the border with Serbia near the village of Roszke. The swimmers turned back towards Serbia after they were spotted, but only one made it.The Hungarian police immediately notified the Serbian authorities and water rescue teams, and launched a search, rescuing the Iraqi family of five from the river at 6:30 a.m. and taking them to hospital, that account said.Hwaish was finally buried in a cemetery in the Hungarian town of Szeged near the Serbian border on Monday, 17 days after police fished his body out of the river.His younger brother, Abdullah al-Hwaish, told Reuters after the burial that nine migrants had tried to cross with the help of a smuggler. The group included an Iraqi family of five and four young men, including the Hwaish brothers from Syria and their younger cousin.When they reached the Hungarian side, they climbed out of the boat into water up to their chests. The smuggler pulled the boat back to the other side on a string, he said.According to his account, which Reuters was unable to verify independently, when the migrants tried to climb the bank of the river, police threw objects at them and sprayed them with a gas which caused his brother to choke and cough. He did not specify the type of gas.""Every time we tried to get out they obstructed us. During the final attempt, they released police dogs on us,"" he said via an interpreter.""The final attempt, when they wanted to release the police dogs, we begged them. They sprayed us with gas and said: 'This is oxygen,'"" he said. ""They just told us: go back (to) Serbia. Go back! Swim! Swim!""By this time, gas was drifting in the air above the water, he said, adding that his brother was a good swimmer but disappeared.(Reporting by Krisztina Than; Editing by Peter Graff)",46.161285,20.078201,Tisza River,Hungary,Reu./LeCourrierdesBalkans/MNS,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-hungary-death-idUSKCN0Z72DU,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,3322,Klara,07/06/2017,New Entry,15/02/2017,Klara

The coastguard rushed two patrol boats, a plane and a helicopter to the scene while at least four ships in the area joined the rescue, throwing lifebuoys to people in the water. About half of the roughly 82ft boat was underwater. The rescue operation took place in international waters, and Egyptian authorities were also involved.Separately, Libya’s navy spokesman said on Friday 117 bodies – 75 women, six children and 36 men – had been recovered after a boat capsized off its shores last week. The death toll was expected to rise.At least 1,000 people have died or are missing and presumed dead after a string of deadly incidents in the Mediterranean over the past week, according to the IOM.The group said on Tuesday that the estimated number of deaths this year up until the end of May rose to 2,443 on all Mediterranean routes after a surge in reported shipwrecks and other incidents in recent days. The number of estimated deaths is 34% higher than in the first five months of 2015. The spate of deaths has caused the IOM to revise its previous assessment.“For the first three weeks of May 2016, IOM estimated just 13 fatalities in three incidents,” the organisation said. “None of them occurred on the eastern Mediterranean route between Turkey and Greece, where through the first four months of the year nearly 400 migrants and refugees drowned. We saw this as a hopeful trend. The events of this past week – with at least 1,000 deaths – have obviously changed our assessment. The past eight days marks one of the deadliest periods yet in the migration crisis, which is now in its fourth year.”About 204,000 migrants and refugees have crossed the Mediterranean since January – more than double the nearly 92,000 who arrived in Europe during the first five months of 2015, according to the IOM. By the end of last year more than a million had made the trip.Hundreds of thousands of mainly Syrian refugees took the short but dangerous route to Greece from Turkey last year in small inflatable boats. That crossing was virtually sealed after a controversial deal between the EU and Turkey in March. Now, warm weather and calmer seas have led to a surge in the number of people trying to reach Italy from Libya, where people-smugglers operate with relative impunity.",34.135285,24.582723,Mediterranean Sea,Greece,Guardian Un./AFP/DailySabah/FamagustaGaz.,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/03/rescue-operation-under-way-as-migrant-boat-capsizes-in-mediterranean,360,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,360,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,360,,,,,360,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,360,,,,,,360,,,,,,,,,,,,,3735,Anouska,23/02/2018,Entry Nihan,03/03/2017,listofdeathsresearch

The coast guard had no details about the nationality of the migrants.The migrants and the six corpses were being taken to the Italian island of Lampedusa, the coast guard said.Italy's coast guard had earlier rescued 33 migrants from a small island off the eastern coast of Sicily on Sunday.Almost 6,000 migrants and refugees sailed from Libya to Italy last week in what appears the start of a wave of at least 100,000 and ""possibly many, many more"" this year, the International Organization for Migration said on Friday. Meanwhile, on the first anniversary of the death of 800 migrants off Lampedusa, Oxfam has accused the EU of failing to protect people seeking refuge in Europe.In a new report, the aid agency said that vulnerable people seeking safety and dignity remain at risk of death, torture and exploitation as they try to reach and cross the Mediterranean.The crossing between Libya and Italy is the deadliest sea route in the world and the death toll for 2016, before today, had already reached 219.Nearly 10,000 people attempted to use this route to reach Europe in March alone.Total arrivals to Italy in the first quarter of 2016 were almost double the number of arrivals in the same period in 2015.Migrant crisis to dominate EU meetingThe migration crisis will top the agenda of a two-day meeting of European Union Foreign Affairs, Defence and Development Ministers that gets under way in Luxembourg today.The meeting of the EU Foreign Affairs Council will discuss the external dimension of migration and finding solutions to migratory pressures.The ministers will also discuss the EU's regional strategy for Syria and Iraq and the threat posed by the so-called Islamic State.Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade Charlie Flanagan will attend the meeting.UN Special Representative for Migration has said that the Italian authorities and people are responding in a very constructive way to the migrat crisis.Speaking to RTÉ's News at One Peter Sutherland, who is visiting migrant camps in southern Italy, said that this is the ""season of major migration from Libya"".He said that the first obligation in Europe has to be to save lives.President calls for solidarity to address challengesPresident Michael D Higgins has called for solidarity and social cohesion to address the challenges facing the EU, including what he referred to as the ""refugee crisis"".Speaking at the inaugural Irish Association of Contemporary European Studies annual lecture at the Royal Irish Academy in Dublin, President Higgins said these issues ""were given a further poignant urgency"" in light of today's reported deaths.Mr Higgins spoke of what he described as ""our current European paralysis"" and ""the crisis in democracy in Europe"".In relation to the AEU's response to the arrival of new migrants, Mr Higgins said confidence and not apprehension should have guided its response.",35.047987,13.842773,Mediterranean Sea,Libya,RTE/BBC/UNHCR/SOSMed/Breitbart,http://www.rte.ie/news/2016/0418/782505-oxfam-eu-migrants/,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6,,,,,,,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6,,,,,,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,3353,Dorien,26-04-2018,New Entry,16/02/2017,Klara
17/04/2016,17/04/16,1,"Maslah Mohamed (22, man)",Somalia,"drowned, trying to reach Italy on an overcrowded boat after leaving refugee camp in Kenya","Ali Mohamed Ali, a Somali refugee living in Dadaab in north-eastern Kenya, was shocked to hear of the death of his younger brother Maslah, 22, in the Mediterranean migrant boat tragedy this month. The boat set sail from Egypt but it is clear that the passengers had come from many places, including Kenya.Ali, 37, said his brother had left Hagadera refugee camp to go to high school in Nairobi. He was in his final year. Radio Ergo’s reporter in Dadaab interviewed Ali about the family’s devastating loss.Q: How did you know that your brother was among those killed in the Mediterranean boat disaster?A: It was 10.00 pm on Sunday night (17th April) and I was in my house with my pregnant wife when I received a call from an unknown number. It was from a man in Greece. He asked me if I knew Maslah Mohamed. When I told him he is my young brother, he said “Allah have mercy on him, I can see his lifeless body in front of me right now. He was one of the many migrants who died in the boat accident.” I couldn’t believe it until he described to me all my brother’s physical features clearly including a scar on his face he has had since childhood.  The caller said he and my brother had made an arrangement before the boat set sail to call each other’s relatives in case anything happened to one of them.I couldn’t sleep the whole night. I called the man back in the morning and asked him to explain exactly how the accident happened. He told me that he and my brother were among around 150 migrants who set off in one boat from the port of Alexandria in Egypt. They were joined by another 250 migrants from another boat. The two groups started to fight for space which led to the boat sinking.Only 35 people, including this man, were able to swim and were rescued by another boat. He told me the rest of the people on the boat died. He estimated more than 400 people drowned. He also told me that my brother had been sick with malaria and therefore he was unable to swim.Q: Did you know your brother was planning to migrate?A: No, I didn’t know! In fact Maslah was passionate about his education. The idea must have just come to his mind after he went to Nairobi. I think he saw many of his Facebook friends who migrated to Europe posting pictures of their lavish lifestyle in Europe. He called me from Cairo and told me his plans. I advised him not to endanger himself but he refused to listen. I begged him to come back and finish his schooling, but my efforts to convince him to change his plans were fruitless.Q: What does the death of your brother mean to your family?A: Our family was already a victim of the civil war in Somalia. My father was killed in Mogadishu in 1995. A few months later, my sick mother died too. Maslah was one year old at that time. Two of my siblings live in Yemen as refugees. Maslah and I came to Dadaab in 2006. I got a job as a waiter in a local restaurant in the camp. I decided to work so that my brother would not have to worry about his life and education. I felt sad when the news of his death reached me, because I have struggled a lot to improve his life and his education. I raised him and his future was promising and bright.Q: What advice would you give to other young people who are planning to migrate?A: My advice to our youth is to go back to the country [Somalia] and start building it. Europe was built by its people and we can build our country too.",32.787816,24.069672,Mediterranean Sea,Italy,RadioErgo,https://radioergo.org/en/blog.php?article_id=2053,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,3751,Geert,07/06/2017,Entry Nihan,03/03/2017,listofdeathsresearch
16/04/2016,16/04/16,6,N.N. ,Cameroon/Gamb/Maurit/CostaRic,died trying to reach Spain from North Africa; 21 rescued,"Era viernes y fue una noche dura de temporal. Pasada la una de la tarde del sábado 16 de abril apareció el primer mensaje: ""Patera con 27 personas (cuatro mujeres y un bebé). Perdida desde anoche en el mar de Alborán. El tiempo no es bueno"". El siguiente mensaje es de poco antes de las siete de la tarde: ""Llegan 21 [personas] y los familiares dicen que salieron 27. Esperando confirmar si hubo una tragedia"". La embarcación fue rescatada por Salvamento Marítimo y sus 21 ocupantes fueron trasladados a Motril. Por el camino se quedaron seis que nunca llegarán a ningún puerto ni volverán a tocar tierra firme, ni vivos ni muertos.""Sí, los familiares nos dicen que han muerto los seis durante el trayecto"", explica Helena Maleno, de Caminando Fronteras. Fue ella la primera en dar la alerta el sábado pasado. ""Son dos chicos costamarfileños, un camerunés, uno de Gambia, uno de Mauritania y otro del que desconocemos la nacionalidad"", enumera Maleno.No están vivos ni muertos, oficialmente. No son una estadística oficial porque en ellas sólo aparecen los rescatados con vida (6.955 en 505 pateras en 2015, según Salvamento Marítimo), pero existen. El año pasado, al menos 195 personas se dejaron la vida intentando llegar a España, la mayor parte en el mar, según el recuento de casos que ha hecho la Asociación Pro Derechos Humanos de Andalucía (APDHA), publicado el viernes en el informe 'Derechos Humanos en la Frontera Sur 2016'. De esas 195 personas, se recuperaron 64 cadáveres. Los otros 131 cuerpos siguen desaparecidos y así seguirán.""Cuando pasan un par de días es prácticamente imposible que queden supervivientes. Quizás, si naufraga la patera entera, puede que haya alguien agarrado a algo que flote, pero cuando son sólo unas pocas personas que han caído al mar, es muy difícil encontrarlas, prácticamente imposible dar con los cuerpos. Nosotros rastreamos cuando tenemos la seguridad de que han desaparecido en aguas españolas"", explica a eldiario.es un especialista que lleva años trabajando en rescates marítimos y que prefiere no dar su nombre.Hasta que no llegan a puerto, los inmigrantes no pueden explicar qué ha pasado durante el trayecto. La mayor parte de los inmigrantes subsaharianos que salen de Marruecos provienen de países francófonos y en las embarcaciones de rescate no suele haber nadie que hable francés.A veces tampoco quieren contarlo: ""Son muchas horas metidos ahí, sin poder moverse, sin estirar las piernas. Puede que crean que ha muerto uno de ellos y le tiren al mar. Puede que un golpe de mar se los lleve. El espacio es mínimo, son muchos en una patera y una ola les hace caer. En algunas ocasiones, pocas pero puede ocurrir, también puede producirse una pelea por el espacio. Cualquier cosa puede hacerles perder a alguien por el camino"".El viaje se hace con un teléfono móvil en la mano y una brújula metida en una cajita de madera. La red telefónica va y viene, y muchas veces es difícil mantener la comunicación con una embarcación que ha dado la alerta. Alarm Phone es una de las organizaciones que se ocupa –lo hace desde 2014- de recoger llamadas y mensajes de auxilio procedentes de las embarcaciones y comunicar la emergencia a los servicios de rescate.""Nosotros monitoreamos y presionamos para el rescate"", explican en Alarm Phone. Con la experiencia que dan 4 años en Marruecos y decenas de viajes intentando alcanzar la costa española, Abdel, un senegalés de 31 años, atiende algunas de esas llamadas: ""Les hago preguntas para conocer su posición y doy el aviso. Hay que tranquilizarles, porque cualquier cosa puede hacerte entrar en pánico"".Abdel no puede recordar cuántos amigos ha perdido en el mar: ""Son demasiados"", responde. También le ha tocado la tarea de dar las malas noticias y comunicar la desaparición de una persona a sus familiares. Muchas veces la familia no quiere asumir la pérdida y se agarran a la esperanza porque no hay cadáver: ""La embarcación de unos amigos volcó y la Marina marroquí recuperó a cuatro supervivientes. Los otros dos murieron. Cyril, un camerunés, era uno de ellos y tuve que llamar a su hermana mayor. Ella quería ir a España para que le buscaran los servicios de rescate desde allí. Pasaron meses hasta que se dieron por vencidos y le hicieron un funeral "".A las tres de la tarde del domingo 17 de abril la operación de rescate de la patera que llegó a Motril estaba cerrada. ""Normalmente se abandona la búsqueda cuando sabemos que no vamos a encontrar nada. Es muy complicado verlos"", señala el especialista en rescates. ""Yo me he encontrado gente con quemaduras de la gasolina y el agua salada. Es terrible cuando rescatas un cadáver que lleva mucho tiempo en el agua"". Entonces sí, ya pasa a ser una estadística enterrada con un número en lugar de un nombre. De apellido, ""Inmigrante sin identificar"".

The discrepancy in the accounts could not be immediately explained. UNHCR said the larger boat was already facing ""terribly overcrowded conditions"" before the newcomers arrived. ""Once transferred to the larger vessel — now with an estimated 500 on board — it began taking on water,"" IOM said, citing survivors' accounts. ""The vessel started to sink and panicking passengers tried to jump into the smaller boats they had arrived in."" ""The survivors told IOM that most of those aboard the larger vessel tragically died,"" the agency said in a statement.It quoted an Ethiopian survivor it identified only as Mohamed as saying: ""I saw my wife and my 2-month old child died at sea, together with my brother-in-law. ... The boat was going down ... down. ... All the people died in a matter of minutes.""The survivors ""drifted at sea for a few days, without food, without anything,"" Mohamed said, adding that he thought ""I was going to die."" He said the travelers had intended to go to Italy, not Greece.In its statement, IOM Athens Chief of Mission Daniel Esdras called the accounts ""heartbreaking"" and said the organization was awaiting investigations by authorities ""to better understand what actually happened and find hopefully evidence against criminal smugglers."" No national authorities in the area have reported any bodies washing ashore. Greek authorities said a cargo ship picked up 41 people on Saturday from a wooden boat that was without steering about 95 nautical miles south of the Greek mainland. The Greek authorities did not describe them as survivors or say anything about any boat sinking.The survivors were then taken to Kalamata, Greece, where IOM and UNHCR staffers interviewed them. UNHCR said the survivors were 23 Somalis, 11 Ethiopians, six Egyptians and a Sudanese.Barbara Molinario, a Rome-based spokeswoman for UNHCR, said details remained unclear and said its staffers didn't want to press the survivors too hard ""as they are still very tried by their experience.""The statements offered the most official comment yet following repeated news reports about the incident in recent days.Somalia's president, prime minister and parliamentary speaker issued a joint statement Monday concerning an unconfirmed report about the incident. Reports of the drownings circulated among families and on social media, but they hadn't been confirmed by coast guard authorities in Italy, Greece, Libya or Egypt.According to IOM's Missing Migrants project, the death toll is the largest from a sinking on the central Mediterranean since another south of Lampedusa in April last year, in which 772 people died. Its largest recorded toll was an October 2013 incident in the same area, when about 800 people died. Several other accidents since then took 400 to 500 lives, its statistics show.More than 1 million migrants and refugees crossed the Mediterranean last year — mostly refugees from war in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria fleeing to Greece and the European Union. However, the longer Libya-Italy route has traditionally seen more deaths.--In April 2016 (probably on the 13th), a major drowning tragedy happened in the Mediterranean, 100km off the coast of Libya, killing around 500 people including 100 children. 240-250 migrants left from Tobruk (Libya) headed for Italy, and when their boat started to capsize, the traffickers forced them onto a cargo ship coming from Egypt which already carried around 300 migrants. The cargo ship capsized during the transfer, probably due to the overcrowding. It is unclear how many people died because the tragedy happened on open sea in the middle of the night.There were 41 survivors (37 men, 3 women and a 3-year-old child). They were either still on the smaller boat when the bigger one capsized, or had managed to swim back to the smaller boat. They drifted on sea for 3 days until they were rescued by a Philippinian commercial ship and brought to Kalamata (Greece) on April 16th. The survivors were from Somalia (23), Ethiopia (11), Egypt (6) and Sudan (1). An Ethiopian survivor said that he saw his wife and baby drowning. From those who died, allegedly at least 200 were from Somalia.The presidents of both Somalia and the self-declared Republic of Somaliland offered their condolences over the incident.--ALEXANDRIA, Egypt, Dec 6 (Reuters) - At around 2 a.m. on Saturday, April 9, a large blue fishing boat carrying hundreds of African migrants and their children capsized just off the coast of Egypt.Some drowned quickly. Others thrashed in the water, yelling for help in Arabic, Somali or Afan Oromo. The few with lifejackets blew whistles that pierced through the shrieks.A solitary electric torch probed the moonless darkness. It came from a smaller boat that was circling, tantalisingly close. The men on that boat, the people-smugglers who had brought their human cargo to this point, were searching only for their comrades. They ignored the screams of the migrants and beat some back into the water.Just 10 migrants managed to scramble up into the smaller boat to join the smugglers and 27 other migrants already aboard.Around 500 adults and children died on the voyage, according to survivor and official estimates, the largest loss of life in the Mediterranean in 2016.Among the dead were an estimated 190 Somalis, around 150 Ethiopians, 80 Egyptians, and some 85 people from Sudan, Syria and other countries. Thirty-seven migrants survived.Awale Sandhool, a 23-year-old who worked at a radio station in Mogadishu and had fled death threats at home, was among the few who swam to safety. Amid the chaos of the sinking, he said, his childhood friend Bilal Milyare had shouted to him from the water before drowning: ""Could we not have been saved?""Until now, no one has tried to answer that question.A Reuters investigation in collaboration with BBC Newsnight has found that in the seven months since the mass drowning, no official body, national or multinational, has held anyone to account for the deaths or even opened an inquiry into the shipwreck.When the news emerged via social media eight days after the sinking, European politicians showed brief interest. Italian President Sergio Mattarella suggested that the world should reflect on ""yet another tragedy in the Mediterranean.""But Italy, where the ship was headed, has not investigated the sinking. Nor has Greece, where the survivors landed, or Egypt, from where the migrants and smugglers set sail. There has been no investigation by any United Nations body, the European Union's frontier agency, the EU police agency, any maritime agency, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or the EU naval task force in the Mediterranean.The only significant official action taken so far has been a fraud case against some of the smugglers in Egypt, sparked by complaints to police by a handful of grieving parents. No one has been apprehended in that case.Reuters has identified the owners of the doomed ship and the ringleaders of the voyage, as well as the people-brokers who assembled the migrants in Cairo and Alexandria and took their money.The investigation demonstrates the gaps in international law enforcement that make it easy for human smugglers to pursue their deadly trade in the Mediterranean. But it also shows what could be done if authorities chose to make a priority of investigating migrant deaths.The official indifference to the disaster contrasts with how nations mobilised after EgyptAir Flight MS804 crashed in the Mediterranean on May 19, killing 66 people. Within hours of the crash, Egypt dispatched warships and air force planes to search for wreckage and survivors. France, Britain and the United States sent their own ships and aircraft. An investigation into what caused the crash and who was responsible continues in both Egypt and France.Rob Wainwright, director of the European police agency, Europol, said that in hindsight his agency should have investigated the April sinking. Reuters inquiries might have exposed a ""gap here in the collective response by Europe"" to such cases, he said in an interview.He said the news agency's inquiries had ""triggered our minds about how we can improve."" In late November he said that Europol would study evidence collected by Reuters with BBC Newsnight - and would consider opening an inquiry into the case, together with Greece or another member state. ""If we can find a way of expediting it and making it operational then we will try to do that.""In Egypt, Judge Khaled al-Nashar, assistant to Egypt's Minister of Justice for Parliamentary and Media Affairs, said he could not confirm what inquiries had taken place into the April sinking but further action was not ruled out. ""If the occurrence of such a crime is proven, Egypt certainly will not hesitate to conduct the necessary investigations to uncover it and arrest the perpetrators and bring them to justice.""Egypt's special ambassador for migration, Naela Jabr, said security agencies were ""doing their utmost"" to fight illegal migration, arresting 5,076 people who tried to migrate illegally in the first six months of the year. Jabr said a people-smuggling law passed by parliament in October and ratified in November would help in the crackdown.Some Egyptian lawyers said the government already had the power to impose justice in the case. They said that smugglers responsible for the voyage could be prosecuted for first-degree homicide, abetting illegal migration, and maritime safety breaches.""I consider putting 500 people on this boat to be murder. There is no other way to describe it,"" said Sabry Tolba, an Egyptian lawyer hired by the families of some of those who died.The November 2000 Palermo Convention against organised crime, signed by all of the nations involved in the tragedy, also requires countries to pass laws, take effective measures and ""cooperate to the fullest extent possible"" to prevent and suppress the smuggling of migrants by sea.This account is based on interviews with people involved in all aspects of the voyage: survivors, relatives of the victims, smugglers, fishermen, coastal residents in Egypt, security and maritime officials, agents who acted as the middlemen between passengers and traffickers, and money changers who handled the cash. Reuters also analysed social media networks to track the links between smugglers and their human cargo.Among the obstacles that had to be overcome: Survivors, fearing repatriation to Egypt and retaliation from the smuggler gangs, initially lied about key details of the trip. Those lies, widely repeated by the media and by UN agencies, have helped delay bringing the perpetrators to account.THE PEOPLE MARKETIn the spring of this year, crowds began gathering every day on Mekka el Mokrama Street in Cairo, where the Egypt headquarters of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is located. They were migrants, most of them from Somalia and Ethiopia, queuing to register with UNHCR so they could temporarily but legally live in Egypt.On the street, brokers circled.""Italy, Italy, Italy,"" they shouted, as they hawked places on boats headed across the Mediterranean.Over the winter, few boats had made that trip. But now the weather was clearing and the people-smuggling business was picking up. By August, more than 11,379 migrants would make it to Italy from Egypt, more than in all of 2015. The Mediterranean would prove deadlier than ever. According to the UNHCR, more than 4,663 people have died trying to cross the sea to Europe this year, a record.One broker touting passage was Hamza Abdirashid, a slim and well-dressed man whose Facebook profile says he comes from the city of Hargeisa in the breakaway part of Somalia known as Somaliland.Sandhool, the young Somali from Mogadishu, met him in the Cairo suburb of Nasr City, where Somali migrants often congregate. ""He came around in a car and asked me if I wanted to go to Europe,"" Sandhool said.The price was $1,800, Sandhool said. But ""Hamza was saying if you take five people along, you will get two for free."" Sandhool said he later negotiated a $500 discount for himself with one of Abdirashid's deputies, another Somali in Cairo.Brokers charged passengers a fee of between $1,300 and $2,500, based on the traveller's ability to pay, according to more than a dozen survivors interviewed. People involved in the business said the broker typically kept $200 of that, passing on the rest to the smugglers.Several other migrants identified Abdirashid as the main broker for Somalis on the April voyage. Other brokers handled other nationalities. The middlemen usually come from the same ethnic group as the migrants.The brokers used messaging on apps like Facebook, WhatsApp and Viber to negotiate with migrants. Records of those interactions could help law enforcement identify the brokers. An analysis of the Facebook friends of Abdirashid, the broker, shows he was connected to at least 10 of those Somalis on board the ship: six victims and four survivors.Contacted on social media, Abdirashid declined to comment about his role as a broker, saying that the issue of illegal migration was sensitive.""I'm a student, I don't want to face problems,"" he wrote in a WhatsApp conversation with a reporter.GOING DOWNIn the evening of Thursday, April 7, a fleet of minibuses moved through the suburbs of Cairo, picking up Somalis and Ethiopians from lay-bys and street corners.The buses were tourist vehicles, hired from a Giza-based company called Honest Tours, said one broker. Emad Monir, transport director of the company, said he was unaware of this trip or any other involving illegal migrants. ""It is like stopping a taxi on the street, the driver doesn't ask the client why is he going to the place.""The buses carried the migrants for three hours to the port city of Alexandria.Sandhool and his fellow travellers were handed to another group of Egyptian smugglers who would earn around $220 a head. For that, the smugglers put migrants temporarily in takhzeen, or storage - apartment buildings in Alexandria or isolated compounds close to the shore. They also took care of el Nazla, or going down, shifting the migrants into waiting boats.It was at this stage that the first known deaths occurred.At dawn on Friday, April 8, after a night waiting in isolated car parks with curtains drawn, a group of Somalis and Ethiopians were offloaded from buses on Alexandria's Miami Beach. The beach is a tourist destination and is typically thronged with pleasure-seekers.It is also fenced off and usually protected by guards. But no guard was visible that day and nobody intervened when smugglers armed with pistols assembled the migrants into groups of 20 or 30 and loaded them onto hasakas, the small wooden boats with engines that ply this part of the coast.""Everyone was being grabbed and thrown on. People were sitting on top of me and I felt a lot of pressure,"" said Sandhool. ""Then the boat started moving.""Within sight of the beach, and well inside Egyptian territorial waters, the hasakas pulled up alongside a small wooden fishing boat with a cover shading its deck. So close to shore, the swell was treacherous. As people struggled out, Sandhool's hasaka began to tip. AbdiAziz Shiyo, a 23-year-from Hargeisa who had played soccer with Sandhool in Cairo, spotted the danger.""Keep the balance!"" he shouted.It was too late. The hasaka overturned and tossed everyone in the water. Shiyo drowned, as did Asad Elmi, a pregnant woman in her twenties, and an unrelated six-month-old child. Others, including Sandhool, managed to scramble onto the fishing boat.Osman Asad Mohamed, a migrant from southern Somalia, also witnessed the deaths. He said smugglers had a spare wooden boat ready to take away the bodies and collect any abandoned luggage.Abdelaziz Yusuf, a criminal lawyer in Cairo, said Egyptian maritime law required all vessels to carry communication equipment and to call for help in an emergency. If anyone died, Yusuf said, the sailors could be prosecuted either under maritime law, for failure to perform their duties, or under civilian law for deliberate failure to act to save a life when they were able. The latter could be deemed premeditated first-degree murder under Article 230 of the Egyptian penal code, which carries a death penalty.By now, the wind was picking up and the swell building. Nevertheless, the fishing boat - about 15 metres (50 feet) long, painted white with a blue and gold stripe along its hull - set off with nearly 200 people aboard.Local sailors identified the boat as one that operated from the small, military-controlled port of Abu Qir further along the coast from Miami Beach. Local fishermen and security officials said smuggling from that port was controlled by Ismail al-Bougy, a powerful 41-year-old who got his start hawking seafood on the street. Bougy's real name, according to the security officials and a police report seen by Reuters, is Ismail Ali.The wooden fishing boat - or ""middle boat,"" as it became known - was to ferry the migrants to a much larger ship. Survivors would later refer to the main vessel as the ""big boat.""That big boat was a deep-sea fishing trawler. It was painted blue and measured around 22 metres (72 feet). According to survivors, it had three decks: a top deck exposed to the weather, a main working deck, and a refrigerated fish-hold accessed via a narrow hatch and ladder.By Friday night, the trawler was stationary offshore, rolling and pitching in growing waves. Instead of fish, the trawler's hold was loaded with more than 300 passengers who had been brought out from other beaches over the previous two days. The smugglers planned to cram another 150 to 200 people into the load.SHIPS AND SMUGGLERSEgypt's Mediterranean coast is tightly controlled by the nation's coast guard and military. Large sea-going vessels can only depart from a handful of creeks or Nile branches - all watched by coast guard towers. For this reason, the identities of ships and crew that run smuggling missions become well-known among fishermen and local coast guard officers.Egypt's coast guard service did not respond to a request to comment.Local fishermen and other smugglers say the ""big boat"" that sank in April was built in a shipyard and registered at the port of Rashid, the modern name for ancient Rosetta, about 50 km (30 miles) northeast of Alexandria.One of Egypt's top people-smugglers, who spoke on condition of anonymity, identified the sunken trawler as the Abu Nawal, registered in Rashid as RSH-123. The smuggler, who is wanted in Italy for allegedly organising other illegal voyages, supplied a set of photographs of the vessel and said he knew about this trip because he was asked to recruit passengers for it but declined.He said fishing boats were made in Rashid specifically for trafficking. ""Nowadays we make boats to work in this business, not to fish. It is a million times more profitable."" With fishing, the net was often empty. But on a smuggling trip, ""you can make $400,000.""The Abu Nawal departed Rashid on March 9 to go fishing and has not returned, according to an April 16 coast guard report received by the fisheries ministry and seen by Reuters.The ship's original owner, Hassan Yehia, is from Burg Mighizel, a village that lies a kilometre across the Nile from Rashid. The village is reputed to be the smuggling capital of the Nile Delta.Yehia says the Abu Nawal was named after his daughter and mother. He gave conflicting accounts of his connection to the ship. He first said he sold the Abu Nawal in March to a Libyan merchant, but later he said he still half-owned the vessel, which was now in Libya.But the people-smuggler said Yehia sold the ship in March to two men he identified as the ringleaders of the April voyage: Bougy, the smuggler from Alexandria, and his partner, Ahmed Obeid, 51. Obeid is known locally as Dr Obeid, or simply ""The Doctor.""Security officials and fishermen described Obeid as the leading smuggler in Burg Mighizel. Both Obeid and Bougy were detained in prison between 2005 and 2008 as a threat to security under Egypt's three-decades-long state of emergency that was lifted in 2012, according to a senior Egyptian security official. The official said the pair remained pivotal in the smuggling business.A broker directly involved in recruiting passengers for the April voyage independently identified Obeid and Bougy as organisers of the fated trip. So did two relatives of Egyptian victims on the voyage, who separately learned of their relatives' fates by questioning the brokers.Yehia, the ship's original owner, said he knew Obeid, who was from the same village. ""You probably already know how dangerous this man could be,"" he said. ""Dangerous to an extent that would make me and others not talk about him.""Police say both Obeid and Bougy have been sentenced in absentia several times by Egyptian courts for offences connected to illegal migration. The latest conviction in absentia, for a misdemeanour over the trafficking of several children who went missing in April, came after a complaint from parents. Both were sentenced to a year in jail, but remain at large.Lawyers said police and prosecutors have not examined any connection with the April sinking. Lawyers also said those convicted of fraud would likely appeal their sentence if they were ever apprehended.Obeid did not respond to messages left at his home in Burg Mighezel. His son Ibrahim said he acknowledged his father had arranged migrant trips but said there was no evidence tying him to the deadly voyage.""If he arranges a trip, he does it in a way that pleases God,"" Ibrahim said, laughing. ""You'll never find any smuggler using his real name, so there isn't real proof that it's my father.""Bougy could not be reached for comment.THE DROWNINGIt was about 2 a.m. on Saturday, April 9, when the middle boat reached the trawler. It was pitch dark and well beyond sight of the Egyptian coast. According to one fisherman with a close connection to smuggling gangs, the two vessels met a couple of hours' sailing off the port of el-Saloum, near the Libyan border.In a rough sea and high winds, the middle boat was roped to the trawler. The smaller vessel's passengers, between 150 and 200 people, were forced to clamber across.As the trawler, or ""big boat,"" rocked about, its growing load suddenly shifted to one side. It listed, and then began to keel over.In panic, the crew on the middle boat cut the tethering lines and pushed their craft, which still had 27 migrants aboard, clear of the trawler.Sandhool was now on the trawler's top deck. He began to pray. ""People on the boat all started screaming and crying together,"" he said. Hundreds were still crammed in the hold.Sandhool was thrown into the water. ""Myself and a couple of young guys started to swim away to try and save ourselves."" Sandhool and a few others had brought along lifejackets; most had not.Muaz Mahmud, an Ethiopian, was also thrown overboard with his wife and two-month-old infant. He survived. His family did not. ""I was trying to save them,"" he said later, tears sweeping down his cheeks. ""But I couldn't save them. They slipped away. Everybody was climbing over and hanging on me but I couldn't even hold on myself. So I took off all my clothes, left everything in the sea and tried to swim. I swam towards the light.""That light was the single torch on the middle boat. For the next half-hour, the vessel moved through the water searching for the trawler's crew and its captain, whose name was Salem. The sailors on that boat ignored the pleas of the migrants in the water and brandished knives, threatening survivors like Muaz. Nevertheless, he made it aboard. But when he grabbed someone else's hand to pull him from the sea, he said a crewman punched him until he let go. The same crewman cut loose a rope that survivors were using to clamber up.Gamachis Abdullah, another Ethiopian student, watched helpless from the middle boat as his mother and two brothers drowned. His eldest brother, Ramadan, nearly made it. ""He was shouting up to me but the crew forcibly made us leave everyone and go,"" Abdullah said.The smugglers rescued Salem and two of the trawler's crew, but within minutes Salem died of an apparent heart attack and his body was dumped overboard. Then the smugglers sailed away, leaving behind, according to Muaz, at least 100 people still alive in the water.Yusuf, the Cairo lawyer, said the overloading of the trawler amounted to premeditated murder. Accepting such a massive load, he said, ensured the vessel had little chance of arriving safely. And just as with the drownings near the shore, he said, while there was no specific Egyptian law about sea disasters, the crew's failure to rescue ""when it was in their hands to save people"" could be interpreted by courts as murder under Egypt's penal code.Nashar, the senior official in the justice ministry, said a murder charge would require proof of a ""special intent to destroy a soul."" In smuggling cases, he said, ""the purpose is to transport individuals and smuggle them in exchange for profit."" But smugglers could be charged with manslaughter, which carries a sentence of up to 10 years in jail. Laws against human trafficking, immigration and maritime laws, and laws protecting women and child rights could also have been violated.The middle boat was equipped with radios, cell phones and a satellite phone, but none of its crew attempted to alert authorities, according to survivors. Instead, they said, the crew discussed whether to kill those left alive.Osman Asad Mohamed, who understood Arabic from living in Yemen, said the proposal came from a tall, thin, pale-coloured smuggler, the one who had cut the ropes between the two ships. ""I remember his words clearly: 'Let's kill all of them and bring our boat back. Most of them are dead; they are of no value to us now.'""Some survivors were so petrified by those words they hid in the middle boat's hold, clutching makeshift weapons for defence. But the smugglers never carried out the threat, said Mohamed, because they decided they were outnumbered by migrants.The crew's failure to call for help was costly, say maritime safety professionals, because many of those in life jackets could have survived for hours. A senior Greek coast guard officer said the sea lanes off Egypt and Libya are busy with traffic exiting the Suez Canal. Those ships could have assisted had the survivors called, he said.Mohamed recalled that just before the trawler sank, he noticed the lights of big ships in the distance.RESCUE AND INACTIONAt about 12.30 p.m. on April 16, a week after the disaster, the headquarters of the Italian coast guard in Rome received its first word of the sinking: a distress call from a satellite phone. The call came from one of the survivors aboard the middle boat.By 2.19 p.m., the Italian coast guard had determined the boat was lying in international waters, within Greece's ""rescue coordination zone."" By treaty, maritime nations have divided the sea up into zones. Each country takes responsibility for rescue operations in its zone, even if it asserts no legal jurisdiction outside territorial waters, typically 12 nautical miles off the coast.Just under two hours later, Greek coast guard officers in the port of Piraeus instructed a Dutch-operated bulk carrier, the 550-foot Eastern Confidence, to change course and find the boat full of survivors.Obliged by maritime law to assist with the rescue, but not to collect evidence, the crew of the Confidence did not check the boat for identification marks or serial numbers that could have shown where the smugglers came from. The Confidence's operators, Orient Shipping Rotterdam, told Reuters the basic details of the rescue but declined further comment.The Confidence ferried the survivors to the Greek port of Kalamata. It was here that they began to tell their story to the Greek coast guard, to the media, to agencies such as UNHCR, and, via phone, to families and friends. The survivors said that up to 500 people had drowned.But while Greek authorities helped in the rescue and aided the survivors, they decided not to investigate the sinking. A source with knowledge of the case said that Greece's coast guard did not refer the case to a criminal prosecutor because there was no indication any crime had been committed on Greek territory.Both the coast guard service and Nikos Paraskevopoulos, the justice minister, declined to comment.If Greek authorities had questioned survivors more closely, they might have learned that some of their accounts were untrue - notably, the initial claim that the migrants had left from Tobruk in western Libya.Based on interviews with survivors in Greece, the UNHCR repeated this erroneous account in an April 20 press statement.In fact, nobody had left from Tobruk.All the migrants set sail from Egypt, according to brokers involved, relatives who spoke to victims just before they embarked, and Egyptian security officials.Sandhool, the young Somali, originally said he had boarded in Tobruk. But he later revised his story. ""I am really sorry I told you a lie,"" he said, explaining that survivors had agreed on the false story because they were worried they might be deported from Europe to Somalia or Egypt.Survivors also failed to disclose that four of the Egyptians on the middle boat were sailors employed in the smuggling gang. Mahmud, the Ethiopian survivor, said the four had urged survivors to lie. ""The Egyptian smugglers were with us, and they told us that the Greece authority would return us ... if we tell them that we are from Egypt. This is the only reason why we told we are from Tobruk.""Other survivors said they were grateful to these crewmen for keeping them alive and taking them to Greece.NO MANDATELike Greece, Frontex, the EU border agency, did not investigate. Izabella Cooper, a spokeswoman, said it had no mandate because launching investigations into potential crimes was a ""power reserved for national authorities.""The European Union runs a naval mission off the Libyan coast - Operation Sophia - to identify and capture smugglers' vessels. In practice, it also operates as a rescue service, picking up more than 16,000 migrants from the sea from January through August 2016.Captain Antonello de Renzis Sonnino, the operation's chief spokesman, said the force operated in an area ""just outside the Libyan territorial waters"" and has so far successfully identified 89 smugglers and traffickers that Italian authorities could prosecute. But asked about the April sinking, he said that based on ""the information we have, the disaster occurred far away from where we had our military vessels.""NATO, which runs a separate naval mission in the Aegean to monitor illegal migration, began operations against people-smuggling in the Mediterranean last month. A spokeswoman said: ""No ships under NATO command were mandated to engage directly in counter-human trafficking activities in the Mediterranean in April.""UNHCR, which assisted the survivors when they reached Athens, said it was not its job to investigate. ""UNHCR is there to help the survivors and warn travellers tempted to take the journey. We do not have the investigative mandate to go after organised crime,"" said chief spokesperson Melissa Fleming.One entity does acknowledge it could investigate: Europol. Wainwright, the Europol chief, said his agency exists to help support such investigations, although it was required to get the cooperation of a member state.Wainwright said he was willing to take the case on and would raise it at senior levels in Greece. But, he said, the country was short of resources and already burdened by a huge influx of migrants. Any response, he said, should ""be a European Union response.""Law enforcement in Europe was increasingly overwhelmed by the scale of challenges posed by illegal migration, he said, whether it was drownings or child migrants who go missing. In contrast, if a single local child went missing in England, France or Germany, it attracted huge resources for police. ""It's almost a parallel world we are living in,"" he said. ""It's very frustrating.""Somalia's Foreign Minister Abdusalam Omer said that the government asked Somali embassies to talk to officials and private organisations, such as those working with migrants, in Italy, Greece, and Egypt.He declined to detail what help Somalia received, but urged a more compassionate response. ""If you can deploy a flotilla of ships ... to stop piracy off the coast of Somalia, why can one not deploy a flotilla of ships that saves lives in the Mediterranean? These are our children. And when I say our children, it is not just the Somali children, it is all our children, it is humanity.""THE TRAIL TO CAIROEgypt also chose not to investigate. Local police in Alexandria mounted a partial inquiry into the disappearance of nine Egyptian teenage boys who left for Italy in April, but have not linked the boys' disappearance to the sinking.One father, Abdo Abdul Hamid of Alexandria, gave a statement to police. That led to a prosecutor's report, reviewed by Reuters, which named some of the smuggling ringleaders. Six of them, including Bougy and Obeid, were convicted in absentia by a court in Alexandria of defrauding the boys' families. All remain at large.""These people have to get punished,"" Abdul Hamid said. ""I will stay after them until they all go to prison.""No Egyptian body has looked into the shipwreck itself, two senior security officials confirmed. Law enforcement officials said an ineffective legal system discourages action, and also blamed the pressure of other work. One senior security source said that illegal immigration was nothing new, and ""the priority is security and drugs at the moment.""Under international law, if any of the ships involved in the disaster were flagged or registered in Egypt, as large fishing trawlers like the Abu Nawal are, then Cairo had a clear mandate and possibly even an obligation to investigate the disaster, according to Niels Frenzen, clinical professor of law at the University of Southern California Gould School of Law.Nashar, the senior official in Egypt's justice ministry, said that investigations into illegal migration were difficult because they often required collecting evidence and chasing criminals across borders, and because migrants were often reluctant to give evidence.But, he said, ""I can confirm it is not in the interests of the investigating agencies, whether the general prosecutor or any relevant law enforcement authority, to cover up on such crimes.""Nashar said that after another sinking in September, Egypt had rushed through the new law ""to combat the crime of illegal migration.""In May, the six Egyptians who'd been rescued and taken to Greece - two teenage migrants and four crew - agreed to be sent home to Egypt. According to Cairo airport police records, the six told authorities they had left from an Egyptian beach.That gave Egypt another reason to investigate. Instead of probing further, though, the police charged the six with crossing a frontier illegally.The two teenage survivors and four smugglers were fined and paid 100 Egyptian pounds apiece, or $11. So far, this is the only punishment meted out in the sinking of the Abu Nawal.(Stephen Grey reported from Athens, Cairo and Alexandria; Amina Ismail from Cairo, Alexandria and Kafr-el-Sheikh; Additional reporting by Sameh Ellaboody in Cairo, Alexandria, Kafr-el-Sheikh and Damietta; Karolina Tagaris in Athens; Crispian Balmer and Steve Scherer in Rome; Edmund Blair in Nairobi; Abdi Sheikh in Mogadishu; and Hussein Ali Noor in Hargeisa; Edited by Simon Robinson)",32.787816,24.069672,Mediterranean Sea,Libya,IOM/UNHCR/NYtimes/Guardian Un./RFI/MigrantReport/BBC/AlArabia/ANSA/Nouvel Obs/Reu./MNS,www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/20/hundreds-feared-dead-in-migrant-shipwreck-off-libya,500,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,500,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,300,,,,200,,,,,,,500,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,500,,,,,,500,,,,,,,,,,,,,3742,Klara,03/05/2018,Entry Nihan,03/03/2017,listofdeathsresearch

The teenager appears to have had a legitimate claim for entry to the UK.Friends of Hussain’s, speaking from the camp at Dunkirk where the teenager had spent six months, revealed that he had family members living in Manchester – whom he was trying to reach – making him eligible to claim asylum in the UK under the EU’s Dublin regulation, which promotes family reunification.The friends accused the Home Office of being responsible for the Hussain’s death, and said charities at the camp had not seen any evidence of British government officials visiting Dunkirk and Calais to assess and register how many refugees were eligible to claim asylum in the UK.Maddie Harris of the charity Help Refugees, who knew Hussain’s cousin in the camp in northern France, said: “He was trying to find a better life and died in the process and our government is responsible for his death.”She said police officers in Oxfordshire had called Hussain’s cousin on Friday evening to reveal details of the tragedy.In a separate incident, an 11-year-old boy from Afghanistan has gone missing after being spotted climbing on to a ferry to Dover on Wednesday morning.Liz Clegg, who runs the women and children’s centre in Calais and looks after scores of unaccompanied minors, said she had tried to contact the youngster, called Kareem, but to no avail. She also said she had contacted Kent police, but they allegedly refused to issue a missing persons report.She said Kareem was an unaccompanied minor, who had been living in her centre at the Calais refugee camp for at least six months.Clegg said: “The officer said that he did not go missing from Kent and my reply was that I am 99.9% certain that he is in Kent. I kept saying it’s an emergency, he’s 11 and doesn’t speak English, but it was a very unhelpful response.“So they then alerted French police hoping that between them they might generate a missing child alert. From our experience in the last few days there appears to be no coordinated response in regards to refugee children going missing.“He is a kind, funny and smart boy all and his friends are deeply concerned and feel powerless to do anything. He has now been missing for days.”Charities on Saturday urged anyone who had seen the young Afghan to contact Help Refugees.It is difficult to make an accurate assessment of the number of refugees who die trying to enter Britain, but a Guardian investigation found that at least 15 migrants had died trying to escape Calais in 2014. Such deaths on British soil are rare.Josie Naughton of Help Refugees said her organisation had ”repeatedly pleaded with the authorities to register the children in the camp. Our warnings about the dangers of not doing so were ignored, with potentially terrible consequences for this young boy.”George Gabriel of Citizens UK said: “The disappearance of this boy is a grim reminder of the dangers faced by hundreds of children who are alone in Calais and Dunkirk. Our governments should be ashamed that they are not doing more to register and protect unaccompanied minors.”",51.724226,-1.03124,Oxfordshire,GB,Guardian Un./Passeurs d’hospitalites,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/02/teenager-from-kurdistan-dies-under-lorry-in-oxfordshire,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3750,Klara,09/06/2017,Entry Nihan,03/03/2017,listofdeathsresearch

The lorry driver continued his journey to Dunkirk, without stopping.--Ce jeudi vers 5 h, un jeune migrant afghan de 22 ans a perdu la vie sur l’autoroute A16. Il a été percuté par un poids lourd à hauteur de la commune de Marck, dans le sens Calais-Dunkerque. À l’arrivée des secours, la victime avait été déplacée par d’autres migrants : près d’une trentaine étaient présents à proximité, à hauteur de l’aire d’autoroute du Beau-Marais.«  Lors de l’intervention des services de secours, le migrant était en arrêt cardiorespiratoire. Il n’a pas pu être réanimé par le SMUR présent sur place  », a expliqué la préfecture du Pas-de-Calais ce jeudi matin. Le jeune homme s’appelerait Ali Sarail. Le chauffeur, slovaque, a été placé en garde à vue ce jeudi et libéré. «  L’homicide involontaire a été retenu  », a indiqué le parquet ce jeudi soir.Selon la préfecture, depuis début 2016, deux décès de migrants ont été constatés. Le 10 février, un migrant afghan de 36 ans était retrouvé noyé dans le port de Calais. Le 2 mars, un migrant soudanais de 54 ans «  décédait à la suite d’une problématique cardiaque  » dans la « jungle ».Lourdement blessé à la têteMardi vers 5 h, c’est un migrant syrien prénommé Mohamad Farour qui était transporté à l’hôpital de Calais dans un état grave après avoir été écrasé par un camion sous lequel il tentait de se dissimuler, au port de Calais. On en sait plus, ce jeudi, sur les circonstances de cet accident, qui s’est produit à proximité du port Est : l’adolescent de 17 ans s’était dissimulé sous une remorque stationnée sur un parking dans l’espoir de pouvoir passer en Angleterre. Deux de ses compatriotes s’étaient dissimulés sous un autre camion, un peu plus loin. Le jeune homme se serait lourdement blessé à la tête lorsque la remorque sous laquelle il se cachait a été raccrochée à un tracteur.D’après une source proche du dossier, le chauffeur du camion, de nationalité roumaine, a vu que l’adolescent s’était blessé, mais n’aurait pas appelé les secours, quittant Calais pour poursuivre sa route en France. C’est auprès d’une patrouille de sécurité que le Syrien blessé, accompagné de ses deux compatriotes, aurait trouvé de l’aide.

We want to go to Germany or France.""A French member of EU border agency Frontex said that officials expected the arrivals to drop off as word spreads about the EU-Turkey agreement.""Information will quickly circulate that the journey has become difficult because of the deal,"" he said.Realistically, migrants will likely not start being returned to Turkey until April 4, according to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, a key backer of the scheme.EU officials have stressed that each application for asylum will be treated individually, with full rights of appeal and proper oversight.The deal also plans major aid for Greece, where some 12,000 people are massed on the Macedonian border alone, in dire conditions.After a string of border closures on the Balkan migrant route that has left Athens dealing with a huge bottleneck, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has demanded reinforcements of 2,300 agents from EU border agency Frontex.The European Commission has said the implementation of the deal will in total require the mobilisation of some 4,000 personnel, including a thousand security staff and military officers, and some 1,500 Greek and European police.France and Germany have offered to send up to 600 police and asylum experts to help Greece implement a deal that Europe hopes will ease its worst migration crisis since World War II.",39.262383,26.371091,Lesbos,Greece,MEOnline/WatchTheMed/Mail Online,http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/?id=75879,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,2,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,3756,Klara,07/06/2017,Entry Nihan,05/03/2017,listofdeathsresearch

It is not known exactly when the three attempted the crossing.""What is happening is that people in Idomeni are in really deep despair,"" added Brashnarska, referring to the Greek town where thousands of refugees have massed, hoping to cross into Macedonia on their way through to northern Europe.""They [refugees] are very frustrated, they are really desperate and fearful that they have come this far and will never be able to move on. That despair makes them do desperate things, like crossing a river that has a level. Many tried to cross. Some got stuck, some were carried by the water.""Brashnarska said the stream is - in normal weather conditions - very shallow.""In order to stop irregular crossings, countries need to provide legal pathways … People will not just stand still. They will want to cross,"" she said.Jesper Frovin Jensen, emergency coordinator for the UN agency for children (UNICEF), said the situation in Macedonia on Tuesday had eased, with border police manning the dangerous crossing.The level of water in the stream had also dropped, he said.But, he added: ""This is a crisis for children, for children this is an emergency. We see more than 60 percent of people here in this region of Europe as women and children. This is a crisis for vulnerable people, and their vulnerability gets bigger and bigger.""The number of families arriving has risen since the start of the year, he said, while the number of single men had dropped.""We call upon everyone to ensure children have the best health possible, even if it is an abnormal situation for them [host countries].""Children were especially at risk, as most do not arrive with suitable clothing for cold European weather, which on Monday in Macedonia dropped to four degrees.""First and foremost, they [children] need to be provided with better [living] conditions,"" he said.Safe passages urgedBorder restrictions implemented on February 21 by Macedonian authorities included a crackdown on crossings by refugees from Afghanistan - a country where civilian casualties reached a record 11,000 in 2015.That move created a build-up of refugees in Greece where more continue to arrive each day.In the past few weeks, the border area has become severely overcrowded, with people forced to camp in cold, wet conditions at Idomeni - where at least 12,000 are now stranded.As the refugee crisis intensifies, rights organisations have called for unity within Europe, with many warning of a looming humanitarian crisis on the continent amid border closures.""[We] have been calling for a long time on EU member states to facilitate safe passage,"" Gerry Simpson, refugee researcher at Human Rights Watch, told Al Jazeera.""These deaths are just the latest in a series of tragedies resulting from the failure to open land borders to asylum seekers,"" he said.Nearly 500 refugees have died while making the perilous journey to Europe across the Mediterranean so far this year, as ongoing conflicts spur a massive jump in the number of arrivals.As of Friday, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said at least 455 refugees and migrants died in the Mediterranean in the first 70 days of the year, from January 1 to March 11. In the first three months of 2015, some 505 refugees and migrants died at sea.In the same 70-day period, at least 146,652 refugees and migrants arrived In Europe, a huge jump from the 20,700 who made the journey in the first quarter of 2015.With 3,771 deaths, 2015 was the deadliest year on record for migrants and refugees crossing the Mediterranean trying to reach Europe, the IOM has said.

12/03/2016,12/03/16,1,"N.N. (15, boy)",unknown,died in Spanish enclave of Melilla while trying to sneak aboard a ship bound for Malaga (E) ,"""No es la primera vez que muere ahogado un menor, ni será la última"", dijo el consejero de Bienestar Social de Melilla cuando el domingo un periodista de El Faro de Melilla le preguntó por el chaval que había muerto ahogado en el puerto de la ciudad. Cuatro buceadores de la Guardia Civil habían encontrado el cuerpo del chico de 15 años apenas 40 minutos después de que alguien les avisara el sábado por la noche. El muchacho falleció junto a la popa del Fortuny, el barco que sale de madrugada hacia Málaga. Es el cuarto joven marroquí muerto en Melilla en los últimos meses intentando cruzar la frontera, trepar un muro o subir a un barco.Abdel (nombre ficticio) había llegado desde Casablanca y pasó poco más de un mes entrando y saliendo de La Purísima, un centro para menores habilitado en un antiguo fuerte militar. La Purísima cierra sus puertas a las 12 de la madrugada, y si un menor no ha vuelto es ""baja"": pasa la noche en el exterior y el centro se desentiende de su búsqueda. Abdel había sido dado de baja del centro en siete ocasiones, según explicó a Melilla Hoy el consejero de Bienestar Social, Daniel Ventura. Una de esas noches, la del sábado, Abdel intentó colarse en un barco y se ahogó.Abdel tampoco era un habitual entre los grupos que viven en la calle, lo que permite dudar de que esos periodos de baja fueran prolongados. ""Casi no lo conocíamos"", explica Rosa García, de la asociación Harraga. Ella conoce a casi todos los chicos de la calle, a los que la asociación ayuda proporcionándoles ropa, organizando actividades deportivas y ofreciéndoles algo de cercanía. Esos menores están bajo la tutela legal de la Ciudad Autónoma de Melilla, que se hace cargo de ellos mediante una concesión a una empresa privada. ""Si yo no vuelvo mis padres salen a buscarme: eso es una tutela"", protesta García. Y eso, desde luego, no ocurre: ""El gobierno tiene una responsabilidad, con los del centro y con los de la calle"".Algunos muchachos dicen que sabían del plan de Abdel. Casi todos los días hay grupos que intentan abordar el barco que une Melilla y Málaga. A eso lo llaman el ""riski"": ""Esta noche voy al riski"". Esperan su momento en las escolleras del puerto de Melilla y con la caída de la noche se juegan su oportunidad a vida o muerte, saltando una valla que sólo hace más peligroso su paso (""vallas para matar niños"", dice Rosa García), o bajando un muro agarrados a una cuerda, o saltando al agua para llegar a nado al barco, como Abdel.En el viaje le iban a acompañar otros dos chicos, pero ellos salvaron la vida. Les rescataron del agua con hipotermia y fueron devueltos a La Purísima en cuanto recibieron el alta. Allí les dan un par de mudas al año, comida y una cama en la que, según cuentan los propios muchachos, llegan a dormir hasta tres chicos porque en el centro, con capacidad para 160 menores, se hacinan hasta 360 chicos. Muchos no hablan demasiado bien de ese lugar y algunos, en torno a 80 actualmente, escapan y vagan por la ciudad sin mucho más que hacer que esperar una oportunidad para colarse en el barco a Europa.En mayo fue Osama, que perdió el agarre de la cuerda que lo sostenía cuando bajaba el muro de la escollera del puerto; poco después un chaval de Nador se ahogó tratando de alcanzar la ciudad; y otro chico se ahogó en Nochevieja, y su cuerpo tardó una semana y un día en aparecer. Son muchos más los que se han roto un brazo o una pierna, asegura José Palazón, de la ONG Prodein. ""Los chavales no están dispuestos a aguantar dos años bloqueados en Melilla y se la juegan"", explica Rosa García. Poco después de recuperar la conciencia uno de los chicos que acompañaba a Abdel y salvó la vida le dijo a Rosa: ""En cuanto me recupere volveré al riski"".Tanto el presidente de la Ciudad Autónoma, Juan José Imbroda, como el consejero de Bienestar Social han anunciado la celebración de una reunión con la Secretaria General de Inmigración y Emigración para abordar, entre otros, este asunto. La Ciudad Autónoma, que en varias ocasiones ha pedido una mayor implicación de Marruecos, no ha respondido a las preguntas remitidas por este medio relativas a la identificación del menor fallecido, su situación en La Purísima, la cifra exacta de ocupación, la posible responsabilidad jurídica de la ciudad o el centro derivada de la tutela del menor, el funcionamiento del sistema de altas y bajas y qué alternativas se estudian para evitar que sigan muriendo jóvenes dispuestos a arriesgarlo todo para saltar a un barco.",35.292797,-2.931333,Melilla,Spain,ElDiario,http://www.eldiario.es/desalambre/ultimo-nino-muerto-riski-Melilla_0_494851644.html,1,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,3763,Klara,07/06/2017,Entry Nihan,05/03/2017,listofdeathsresearch

De son côté, la Ligue algérienne des droits de l’homme (LADDH) fait état de « 5 morts et 30 blessés » accusant les pouvoirs publics d’avoir dissimulé les corps des migrants. Le chef de la sûreté départementale, le wali (préfet) ainsi que le directeur de la santé ont réfuté ces accusations.« En plus des multiples violations des droits de l’homme qu’ils subissent au quotidien, ces migrants, démunis et sans papiers pour la plupart, sont devenus une cible facile », s’indigne Salah Dabouz, le président de la LADDH. Main-d’œuvre bon marché, ils sont souvent accusés de vol et de sorcellerie. En novembre 2014, dans le même département, un autre jeune homme, Mohamed Bensayeh, 33 ans, avait été tué par des réfugiés à coups de couteau. En représailles, leur camp avait été attaqué et réduit en cendres. Seize personnes avaient été tuées, selon un bilan officiel.Lire aussi :   Les invisibles d’Algérie, naufragés sur la route de l’EuropeLe nombre des migrants subsahariens en Algérie est mal connu. La gendarmerie nationale avance le chiffre de 150 000. Dans une enquête publiée en février, l’ONG Médecins du monde indique que 43 % des migrants vivant sur le sol algérien viennent du Cameroun, suivis directement des Nigériens, des Nigérians, des Maliens, des Congolais (Kinshasa) et des Ivoiriens.Procédures de retourPour mettre un terme à ces affrontements, les autorités algériennes ont décidé de déplacer les migrants subsahariens de Ouargla à Tamanrasset, une ville où transitent les exilés venus du Mali et du Niger. 1 200 ont déjà parcouru les 1 600 km qui séparent les deux villes, encadrés par le Croissant-Rouge algérien (CRA). Un cortège de treize bus, suivi d’une vingtaine de camions pour les bagages avec 80 chauffeurs relais, une équipe médicale et un convoi sécuritaire et humanitaire du CRA ont été mobilisés. « Reste 200 migrants à prendre en charge dans les jours à venir », explique Saïda Benhabyles, présidente du CRA, jointe par téléphone.La responsable du RCA dément par ailleurs les rumeurs annonçant un rapatriement massif des migrants dans leurs pays d’origine une fois accueillis à Tamanrasset. « Seuls 250 Nigériens seront rapatriés à la demande des autorités de leur pays, les autres pourront rester à Tamanrasset, affirme-t-elle. Des réseaux de mendicité de femmes et d’enfants nigériens ont été démantelés sur le sol algérien. J’ai donné instruction d’épargner les femmes enceintes jusqu’à accouchement et de soigner les malades avant de les rapatrier. Chaque personne quittera le sol algérien avec un sac de 75 kg de denrées alimentaires. » Plusieurs missions de rapatriement ont déjà été menées depuis 2014.Le CRA sensibilise les migrants sur les procédures de retour, mais peu se portent volontaires. Ils exigent une prise en charge financière ou un travail avant de repasser la frontière.Lors du sommet de La Valette sur la migration en novembre 2015, les dirigeants européens et africains se sont entendus sur l’octroi d’un fonds d’aide d’1,8 milliard d’euros destiné à l’Afrique. C’est dans ce cadre que 500 000 francs suisses (456 000 euros) ont été versés par le gouvernement suisse pour les Nigériens rapatriés d’Algérie, redistribués sous la forme d’une aide à la réalisation de microprojets.

05/03/2016,05/03/16,2,N.N. ,Syria,shot by Turkish border police while they tried to cross from Syria to Turkey,"Turkish border police are shooting refugees dead as they flee Syria. Over the past four months, a total of 16 migrants, including three children were killed by guards as they tried to cross into Turkey, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights claimed.An officer with the British-backed Free Syrian Police and a Syrian smuggler living in Turkey however said that the number of Syrian refugees killed while trying to get into Turkey was higher. According to the monitoring NGO, on 6 February, a man and his child was killed in Ras al-Ain on the eastern stretch of the Syrian-Turkish border.On 5 March, two migrants were shot dead at Guvveci, on the western flank of the border. The human smuggler told The Times that refugees still cross the border but they are in danger of either being killed or captured.The newspaper claims that Turkey started its crackdown on refugees in December after four years of free movement into the country even allowing in Syrians who did not have passports. The clamp down, it said, was due to growing pressure from the West to stop the number of foreign fighters using the border as a gateway to the Islamic State territory.The Turkish government says that it is still keeping an open-border policy for Syrians whose lives are under imminent threat. The newspaper however noted that tens of thousands of people who fled fighting in the Aleppo province last month remain trapped behind the closed border.The Times also said that a huge concrete wall is being built along the border, replacing the rolls of barbed wire. More security forces have also been drafted in after the governor of the border province of Gaziantep declared a special security zone in mid-December.A people smuggler told the newspaper that he had been part of a small gang providing a route into Turkey for £24 per person. He said that four months ago, the killings of fleeing refugees started.He claims that the real number of refugees shot by Turkish border guards was higher as the bodies of those killed on the Syrian side were often taken back to be buried in the war zone. The lucky ones are those who were injured on the Turkish side. They are taken to a Turkish hospital for treatment and then allowed to stay, he said.The European Union has made a pact with Turkey to help deal with the growing refugee problem in the continent. Under the deal, Ankara will take back all migrants who cross to Greece illegally by sea. In exchange, the EU will take in thousands of Syrian refugees directly from Turkey.

The deceased woman was a mother of three of the children and the teenager who died was a member of one of the other families, Angelov told Bulgarian National Television on Monday.Since 2014, Bulgaria has been constructing a 132-kilometre-long barbed-wire fence along its land border with Turkey to prevent refugees and migrants from entering the country illegally.But people fleeing the wars and poverty in the Middle East continue crossing into Bulgaria on their way to Western Europe, often taking dangerous routes in order to remain unnoticed.The number of asylum claims in Bulgaria this year so far reached 1,862 by January 27, when the State Agency for Refugees announced its latest statistics.“We register attempts at illegal crossing along the whole border with Turkey, more often at locations where there is no border installation,” Lubenova explained.The two female refugees’ deaths were not the first such tragedy Bulgaria.In November 2014, the bodies of four men were found near the village of Kireevo in south-western Bulgaria near the border with Serbia.In January 2016, border guards found two other bodies of young migrants near Kalotina at the Bulgarian-Serbian Border, Club Z has reported.The Turkish Anadolu Agency reported on February 6 meanwhile that a group of 31 Syrians, including 13 children, was rescued by villagers and security forces in a village near Edirne in Northern Turkey.The refugees told the troops who found them that they had managed to enter Bulgaria, but Bulgarian border guards intercepted them and sent them back to Turkey on foot.",42.051874,27.644176,Malko Tarnovo,Bulgaria,BalkanInsight/MailOnline,http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/migrant-woman-and-child-freeze-to-death-in-bulgaria-02-08-2016,2,,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,3765,Dorien,26-04-2018,Entry Nihan,05/03/2017,listofdeathsresearch

Recent fighting in Syria has sent thousands of people fleeing towards the Turkish border.The sea route from Turkey to Greece was the most popular way for migrants trying to enter Europe in 2015.Migrant crisis: In depth reportCrisis in graphicsIn the latest incident, Turkish media quoted official as saying that 40 migrants set out for Lesbos from the Altinoluk area early on Monday. They say their boat capsized two miles (3.2km) into the crossing.Hurriyet newspaper says the vessel was using a new route, because security forces have stepped up moves to deter migrants from taking their chances.The paper also denied earlier media reports that another migrant boat had capsized further south off Izmir province.News of the deaths came as Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel was in Turkey to discuss ways of reducing the number of migrants travelling to Europe.After talks with Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, Mrs Merkel said they had agreed to seek help from Nato - both countries are members - in handling the migrant crisis.She said they would use the next meeting of the alliance to consider ""to what extent Nato can be helpful with the surveillance situation at sea'' and support the EU border agency Frontex.The IOM says more than 68,000 migrants arrived on Greek shores in the first five weeks of 2016, despite often stormy conditions. This is a huge rise from last year, when the figure for the whole of January was less than 1,500.Nearly half of those who have arrived in Greece this year are from Syria, the IOM says.But thousands of Syrians seeking to flee a government offensive in Aleppo, backed by Russian air strikes, are being prevented from leaving their homeland.Turkey has so far closed the border to most of the 30,000 migrants gathering at the Kilis border crossing, despite appeals by EU leaders to let them cross.After her talks in Ankara, Mrs Merkel said: ""In the past days we have been not only shocked but horrified by the human suffering of tens of thousands of people through bomb attacks predominantly carried out by the Russian side.""Mr Davutoglu said his country would accept the migrants ""when necessary"", and that it would reveal plans next week to slow the flow of arrivals.Turkish media reactionsCalls from EU leaders for Turkey to open its borders to Syrian refugees have been criticised by both pro-government and opposition commentators in Turkey.The opposition daily Cumhuriyet says: ""While the EU is increasing security measures and closing borders to immigrants, it is asking Turkey to let them in.""The pro-government Yeni Safak says the calls from EU leaders are redolent of ""hypocrisy"". The paper describes the treatment of immigrants in Europe as ""inhumane"".A columnist for the centre-right paper Hurriyet, Fatih Cekirge, also expresses indignation. He says world powers have different agendas with regard to Syria, but they are all sending the same message: ""Don't come to Europe as a refugee, but die far from us.""",39.464261,26.676178,Aegean Sea,Turkey,BBC/Guardian,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35523235,27,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,27,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,27,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,27,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,27,,,,,,27,,,,,,,,,,,,,3790,Geert,07/06/2017,Entry Nihan,07/03/2017,listofdeathsresearch

La patera llegó a Canarias cinco días después de haber salido desde la costa de Cabo Bojador, en el Sáhara Occidental, con 42 supervivientes en tan mal estado, que hubo que trasladar a quince de ellos a centros sanitarios, donde uno falleció poco después. Hernández Bento ha explicado que la Policía ha detenido a los dos presuntos patrones de la patera y tiene identificados a otros cinco, que posiblemente también serán arrestados, porque existen testimonios que les acusan de haber acaparado alimentos que negaron a sus compañeros de travesía. El delegado del Gobierno ha precisado que, por ahora, no se ha podido concretar la identidad del resto de ocupantes de la patera, ni siquiera del inmigrante fallecido en el Hospital Insular. Hernández Bento ha felicitado a los agentes del Cuerpo de la Policía Nacional por la labor que han realizado en estos días para atender lo mejor posible a los inmigrantes y por hacer ver a la Consejería de Sanidad del Gobierno de Canarias que era urgente derivarlos a los distintos hospitales de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. Debemos todos ponernos las pilas y actualizar los protocolos de actuación de los CIEEn su opinión, la situación que se vivió en la Comisaría de Maspalomas (San Bartolomé de Tirajana) tras la llegada de la patera fue ""dantesca"", ya que el estado en el que se encontraban algunos de sus ocupantes no se correspondía con la que se suponía que deberían tener tras haber sido dados de alta en los centros de salud. El delegado del Gobierno ha destacado que este mismo miércoles tres de los inmigrantes que habían ingresado en el Centro de Internamiento de Extranjeros (CIE) de Barranco Seco han sido derivados a un hospital capitalino porque, aunque su vida no corre peligro, están tan débiles que no pueden ni levantarse de la cama. ""Observo que sus heridas son de gravedad y que precisan atención en un centro médico"", ha destacado Hernández Bento, quien ha informado al consejero de Sanidad Jesús Morera de la problemática y de la necesidad de su ingreso en el Hospital Insular. En su opinión, las instituciones que están implicadas en este asunto deben revisar y actualizar ya sus protocolos de actuación, para que no se den situaciones como las que se han vivido en los dos últimos días porque ""parecía que nadie quería hacerse cargo de unos inmigrantes que venían en un muy mal estado de salud"". ""De hecho, uno de los inmigrantes falleció esa misma noche en el Hospital Insular. Debemos todos ponernos las pilas y si hay que sentarse para diseñar un protocolo más adecuado al actual, desde luego por parte nuestra no va a quedar"", ha agregado.  Se triplica el número de inmigrantes llegados en patera El número de inmigrantes llegados en pateras a Canarias se triplicó en 2015 con respecto a 2014, hasta cerrar el año con 874 personas rescatadas o interceptadas en sus costas y con indicios de que ya no solo parten de Marruecos y el Sáhara, sino también más al sur, desde Mauritania. De acuerdo con cifras que facilita la agencia europea de Fronteras (Frontex), el año pasado llegaron al archipiélago canario en pateras o cayucos más inmigrantes que en los tres años anteriores juntos: 874 frente a 695 (170 en 2012, 250 en 2013 y 275 en 2014). Desde Cruz Roja, el subdirector de migración, Jose Javier Sánchez Espinosa, señaló a 20minutos que una posible causa de este incremento podría ser el deterioro de la situación en el Sahel y la inseguridad alimentaria de la zona. En su último informe anual sobre la situación del fenómeno migratorio en Europa, Frontex recuerda que Canarias llegó a ser hace diez años el principal punto de entrada de inmigrantes irregulares por mar en la Unión Europea, con casi 32.000 personas en 2006. Por eso subraya que, a pesar del repunte de actividad que se ha detectado en las rutas hacia las islas, con un crecimiento del 217 % de 2014 a 2015 (599 personas más), las cifras de inmigración irregular por vía de pateras en Canarias son ""irrelevantes"". A pesar del repunte, las cifras de inmigración irregular por vía de pateras en Canarias son ""irrelevantes"" De hecho, a su juicio, la 874 frente a 695 de pateras o cayucos a Canarias sigue estando ""efectivamente cerrada"", lo que impulsa a las redes de inmigración ilegal a probar otras opciones, como la de embarcar personas en barcos mercantes, como polizones o con la complicidad de las tripulaciones, como ha detectado la Gendarmería senegalesa. La mayor parte de las pateras que llegaron a Canarias en 2015 o que fueron rescatadas cerca de sus costas habían partido de Marruecos o del Sahara Occidental, desde las costas de Agadir, Sidi Ifni, El Oauatia (Tan-Tan), Tarfaya, El Aaiún, Cabo Bojador o Dajla. Frontex considera que el grueso del tráfico de pateras que persiste entre la costa de Marruecos y del Sahara y Canarias no está organizado por mafias, sino por individuos concretos. ""Los pasajes en las pateras suelen ser concertados por individuos que trabajan de manera independiente y sirven a clientes que han llegado por a la costa por su cuenta, sin recurrir a redes organizadas"", apunta la agencia de fronteras de la UE. Sin embargo, también remarca que las características de algunas barcas llegadas a Lanzarote, de pequeño tamaño y con muy pocos inmigrantes a bordo, sugieren que el principal objetivo de algunos viajes no era introducir personas en las islas, sino drogas. Ruta hacia Canarias La ruta hacia Canarias, recuerda Frontex, tiene un alto índice de devoluciones de los inmigrantes hacia sus países de origen, ""lo que contribuye a que el números de salidas y el número de fallecimientos en ella sea bajo"". ""Aun así, al menos doce personas murieron en marzo de 2015 en dos incidentes distintos ocurridos con pateras que había partido desde Marruecos"", añade. Aunque el informe de Frontex (publicado este enero) apunta que la última llegada a Canarias de pateras desde Mauritania se remonta a junio de 2014, en las últimas semanas se han producido noticias que sugieren que su información al respecto puede no estar actualizada y que los inmigrantes vuelven a intentar zarpar desde ese país. En diciembre, la Gendarmería de Mauritania detuvo al presunto organizador de dos cayucos con inmigrantes que han consiguieron llegar a Canarias desde las costas de ese país: uno a Gran Canaria en septiembre, con 38 personas, y otro a Tenerife en noviembre, con 18 personas, según informó la Guardia Civil, cuyos efectivos en Mauritania colaboraron en la operación.",27.102838,-14.93042,Atlantic Ocean,Spain,20ME,http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/2669886/0/inmigrantes-muertos-patera-canarias/,5,,,,,,,,,,,,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,,,,,,,,,,,5,,,,,,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,3771,Geert,07/06/2017,Entry Nihan,06/03/2017,listofdeathsresearch

06/02/2016,06/02/16,2,"N.N. (child, man)",Syria,shot by Turkish border police while trying to cross border from Syria to Turkey,"Turkish border police are shooting refugees dead as they flee Syria. Over the past four months, a total of 16 migrants, including three children were killed by guards as they tried to cross into Turkey, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights claimed.An officer with the British-backed Free Syrian Police and a Syrian smuggler living in Turkey however said that the number of Syrian refugees killed while trying to get into Turkey was higher. According to the monitoring NGO, on 6 February, a man and his child was killed in Ras al-Ain on the eastern stretch of the Syrian-Turkish border.On 5 March, two migrants were shot dead at Guvveci, on the western flank of the border. The human smuggler told The Times that refugees still cross the border but they are in danger of either being killed or captured.The newspaper claims that Turkey started its crackdown on refugees in December after four years of free movement into the country even allowing in Syrians who did not have passports. The clamp down, it said, was due to growing pressure from the West to stop the number of foreign fighters using the border as a gateway to the Islamic State territory.The Turkish government says that it is still keeping an open-border policy for Syrians whose lives are under imminent threat. The newspaper however noted that tens of thousands of people who fled fighting in the Aleppo province last month remain trapped behind the closed border.The Times also said that a huge concrete wall is being built along the border, replacing the rolls of barbed wire. More security forces have also been drafted in after the governor of the border province of Gaziantep declared a special security zone in mid-December.A people smuggler told the newspaper that he had been part of a small gang providing a route into Turkey for £24 per person. He said that four months ago, the killings of fleeing refugees started.He claims that the real number of refugees shot by Turkish border guards was higher as the bodies of those killed on the Syrian side were often taken back to be buried in the war zone. The lucky ones are those who were injured on the Turkish side. They are taken to a Turkish hospital for treatment and then allowed to stay, he said.The European Union has made a pact with Turkey to help deal with the growing refugee problem in the continent. Under the deal, Ankara will take back all migrants who cross to Greece illegally by sea. In exchange, the EU will take in thousands of Syrian refugees directly from Turkey. In addition, Turkish citizens will get visa-free travel in the Schengen zone from June.",36.848108,40.078687,Ras al-Ain,Turkey,IBTimes,http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/turkish-border-police-shooting-refugees-dead-they-flee-syria-1552342,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,2,,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,,,,,,2,,1,,,,,,,,3334,Klara,02/06/2017,New Entry,16/02/2017,Klara

(4 babies, 6 children)",Syria/Afghanistan/Myanmar,died after boat from Turkey carrying migrants to Lesbos (GR) slammed into rocks in Aegean Sea,"At least 37 migrants drown trying to reach GreeceBy SUZAN FRASER Jan. 30, 2016 9:51 PM ESTANKARA, Turkey (AP) — A boat carrying Syrians attempting the short sea journey from Turkey to Greece struck rocks and capsized at dawn on Saturday, causing at least 37 people to drown, among them several babies and young children.Images of dead children on a beach on Saturday were another soul-searing reminder that Europe's migrant crisis keeps destroying lives and families by the day.They recalled the photo of 3-year-old Aylan Kurdi lying face down on a Turkish beach last year. His story put an intimate face on the Syrian refugee crisis for people across the world, prompting many to finally grapple with the magnitude of the suffering caused by the war in the Middle East and the treacherous journeys many risk seeking shelter in Europe.By contrast, the heartbreaking images Saturday met a muted response, perhaps a sign that many have grown weary of the unending reports about the suffering of migrants even though the number of people dying at sea is rising.""January has been the deadliest month so far for drownings between Turkey and Greece,"" Peter Bouckaert, the emergencies director at Human Rights Watch, told The Associated Press in an email. ""Almost every day, more drown on this dangerous journey.""""It is deeply disturbing that after all those solemn pledges when Aylan Kurdi drowned, these latest drownings were barely mentioned in the media,"" added Bouckaert, who played a crucial role in giving wide circulation on Twitter to the images of Kurdi last year. ""We have chosen to look away.""Tima Kurdi , the Kurdi's aunt, said she is heartbroken to know that children continue to die as her nephew did.""No parent would put their children in that kind of situation unless what they were escaping from was worse,"" she told the AP, speaking from a hair salon she recently opened in Port Coquitlam, British Columbia.""The image of my nephew Alan Kurdi was really powerful. People started to look at the crisis. But now, another boy and another boy and another boy are drowned,"" she said. ""I wish the world would not forget my nephew and his tragedy. We have to stop the war or this won't stop.""While Turkish authorities gave the boy's first name as Aylan, his aunt says the family prefers that it be transliterated as Alan.Saturday's tragedy occurred when the boat capsized as dozens of people attempted the deceptively short crossing from the Turkish coast to the Greek island of Lesbos barely 5 miles (8 kilometers) away.More than 250 migrants have drowned already this month trying to reach one of Greece's offshore islands, entry point to the European Union and its uncertain promise of refuge from war and poverty.The Turkish coast guard said three ships, a helicopter and team of divers searched the partially submerged craft and surrounding seas for more bodies as police on shore placed bodies, some 10 children among them, in black bags.Journalists at the scene tried to interview some of the 75 survivors, but police took them away in buses, some bound for a local hospital to be treated for hypothermia and other injuries, others into police custody for questioning.A Turkish government official said by the late afternoon that rescuers had recovered bodies trapped inside the wreckage of the 17-meter (56-foot) boat, which sank shortly after departing from the shore near the Aegean resort of Ayvacik, raising the death toll to 37. Saim Eskioglu, deputy governor for the coastal Canakkale province that includes Ayvacik, said the boat ""hit rocks soon after it left the coast.""""There were around 10 children among the dead,"" Eskioglu said. ""Four of them, unfortunately, were babies about one or two years old. We are deeply saddened.""Eskioglu and Ayvacik's mayor, Mehmet Unal Sahin, said most of the migrants were Syrians. The Anadolu Agency said the boat also bore natives of Afghanistan and Myanmar.A private Turkish news agency, Dogan, said police arrested a Turkish man suspected of being the smuggler who organized Saturday's failed sea crossing. The man denied responsibility, telling the Dogan agency that he also had relatives on board.Weather conditions did not appear to be a significant factor in the sinking. Journalists at the scene said weather conditions Saturday on the Turkish coast were relatively mild, with light winds and temperatures around 12 degrees Celsius (54 Fahrenheit).The International Organization for Migration says drowning deaths are running at four times the rate of 2015, when many thousands daily sought to enter the European Union via Turkey by reaching one of more than a dozen offshore Greek islands, chiefly Lesbos.The agency recorded 805 drowning deaths of migrants on Turkey-Greece sea routes throughout 2015, and a further 218 this month alone excluding the ultimate total of Saturday's tragedy.Joel Millman, a spokesman for the International Organization for Migration, said the death toll was ""increasing at an alarming rate."" He said it was all the more surprising, given the reality that fewer people are attempting the crossing during winter.Turkey, which is hosting an estimated 2.5 million refugees from Syria, in November agreed to fight smuggling networks and stem the flow of migrants into Europe. In return, the European Union pledged 3 billion euros ($3.25 billion) to help improve the refugees' conditions.The country says it has started rejecting Syrians who arrive without valid visas via third countries. It also has agreed to grant work permits to Syrians as an incentive for them to stay put in Turkey.",39.479102,26.467438,Aegean Sea,Greece,AP/NYtimes/WPost/AA/BBC/Independent/FR-BW/ProAsyl,http://bigstory.ap.org/article/e58c62fd58f64865bc232dcb27249cdc/10-greece-bound-migrants-drown-turkish-coast,41,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,41,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,41,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,41,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,41,,,,,,41,,,,,,,,,,,,,3776,Klara,01/05/2018,Entry Nihan,06/03/2017,listofdeathsresearch

Als vooruitgeschoven pion van zijn gezin hoopte hij in Nederland een veilig bestaan voor hen te vinden. Maar hij moest wachten tot zijn asielaanvraag in behandeling werd genomen. Terwijl hij wachtte in het veilige Alphen aan den Rijn, werd de situatie van zijn gezin nabij Bagdad penibeler. Afgelopen donderdag kregen sommige vluchtelingen in de opvang te horen dat het een halfjaar extra zou kunnen duren voor ze hun status zouden krijgen en hun gezin kon overkomen. Hussein had al eerder de conclusie getrokken dat hij misschien maar beter terug kon keren naar zijn gezin.SleutelGefrustreerd door de lange wachttijd reisde hij drie keer naar het centrum in Ter Apel. Daar lag zijn paspoort, dat bij binnenkomst was ingenomen. Daar lag de sleutel tot een vrijwillige terugkeer naar Irak. ,,Naar zijn gezin in nood, dat het niet langer uithield zonder hem'', beschrijft Akram Shawki van de Stichting Hoop voor Vluchtelingen op Facebook. Paspoorten worden ingenomen om te onderzoeken of ze niet vervalst zijn, zegt Loes Vellenga, voorzitter van de vereniging van asieladvocaten. ,,Omdat er een heleboel vluchtelingen binnenkomen, worden heel veel paspoorten ingenomen. Dan kan dat onderzoek langer duren.''Drie keer vroeg Hussein tevergeefs om teruggave van zijn paspoort. Waarom hij het niet kreeg, blijft onduidelijk. Shawki: ,,Eén keer sliep hij op straat in Ter Apel, omdat hij niet werd toegelaten. Wanhopig keerde hij terug naar Alphen.'' Hussein vroeg het Centraal Orgaan opvang asielzoekers (COA) om hulp. Hij moest eerst een afspraak maken, zei het COA. En dat kon op z'n vroegst over 2 weken.Zaterdag was zijn geduld op en vervloog zijn laatste sprankje hoop. In een telefoongesprek met zijn vrouw liepen de gemoederen hoog op. Shwaki: ,,Zijn vrouw had geen geld meer om voor hun kinderen en zichzelf te zorgen en om eten te kopen. Helemaal wanhopig filmde hij zijn celkamer om aan zijn vrouw te laten zien waar hij verbleef en verhing zichzelf tijdens het telefoongesprek. Hij zag geen uitweg meer.''

Six different contact persons and solidarity groups like United Rescue and Nawal Soufi's activist collective informed us via WhatsApp about a boat in urgent distress on the way to Lesvos, but still in Turkish waters and we received several GPS coordinates. We immediately reached out to both the Turkish and the Greek Coastguards. The Greek Coastguard referred us to the Turkish coastguard, because the positions were in Turkish waters. We also called the three contact numbers of travellers on the boat(s) and were successful in one case. The person we talked to confirmed that they were in urgent distress, facing extremely high waves. At 1am the Turkish coastguard told us that they were looking for the boat(s). At 1.30am, when we checked with them again, they explained that the weather conditions were rough, but that they continued the search and rescue operation. Other groups, who were also involved in the case, had quite a different experience with the Turkish Coast Guard. They tols us, they had the impression that the Turkish Coastguard was not really cooperating.At 2am we received the news from two of the contact persons that the Turkish coastguard had rescued the travellers. However, one solidarity group involved in the case, Nawal Soufi's activist collective told us at 2.47am that a boat had capsized and that about 18 persons including many children had died. We tried to reach out to the travellers again, to get the rescue confirmed, but without success. None of the other contact persons had heard about the shipwreck. Only later through a follow-up research we learned that from one boat, several passenger had drowned during the night, while other had been rescued by the Turkish Coast Guard and had been brought to Turkey. On Tuesday morning and throughout the day, we called the Turkish coastguard to inquire about the rescue operations and the deaths. They told us that they had carried out several rescue operations during the night and in the morning. At 8am local time, they had rescued 12 persons, but several others had died. Around noon on Tuesday, the media started to report about two shipwrecks and many deaths. According to several sources, 34 or 36 bodies washed ashore at the Aegean Coast, in the district of Ayvalık and the district of Dikili. The media reports did not mention the boat that had capsized during the night, but referred to one or two boats that had left Turkey in direction of Lesvos on early Tuesday morning and that had capsized a few hours later. The media also stated that 12 persons were rescued by the Turkish coastguard from the sea and the rocks near Ayvalık and that the survivors, who were suffering from hypothermia, were brought to a hospital.In a press conference on Wednesday, the 6th of January a spokesperson of the Turkish government party AKP blamed Greece for the most recent tragedy, claiming that a boat with 55 travellers had capsized after a refoulement through the Greek naval authorities. The Hellenic Coast Guard rejected this claim in an official statement, published the same day. Solidarity groups in Turkey and Greece, however, underlined that the Turkish Coastguard had reacted too late to the alerts sent by Turkish citizens and other solidarity groups.	",39.162511,26.802521,"Balikesir, Izmir",Turkey,WatchTheMed/Irish Times/Mail Online,http://www.watchthemed.net/index.php/reports/view/405,34,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,34,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,34,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,34,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,34,,,,,,34,,,,,,,,,,,,,3792,Klara,07/06/2017,Entry Nihan,07/03/2017,listofdeathsresearch

03/01/2016,03/01/16,1,"Masud Naveed (15, boy)",Afghanistan,died trying to reach his sister in Great Britain after his asylum hearing was denied,"additional links:http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-3418156/Brother-law-reveals-dismay-death-Afghan-refugee-15-bid-reach-UK.htmlCalais ‘Jungle’: anger over fate of child refugees denied UK asylum hearingMasud, 15, died on a lorry after losing hope that his claim to live with his sister in Britain would ever be heardJust before the New Year, Masud decided he couldn’t wait any longer. Christmas had come and gone. Life in the sprawling Calais “Jungle”, a squalid home for up to 6,000 migrants, was becoming increasingly unbearable for the 15-year-old. He had a legitimate claim for entry to the UK because he has a sister living here. But no one, least of all the British government, was listening.Mohammad Nabi, a fellow Afghan who had shared a tent with Masud since the teenager arrived alone at the Jungle three months ago, said: “He had extremely high hopes for the future and was looking forward to a life in Britain. But as he waited for his case to be heard he thought: ‘Well, why not try myself?’”On 27 December, Masud, who had travelled from the Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif, where the Afghan army was battling militants only last week, packed some belongings and decided to take matters into his own hands. He headed to nearby Dunkirk and, the following day, managed to climb into the back of a lorry headed for England. “After a few days we wondered what had happened to him,” said Nabi. “We began calling but his phone rang out, then we started texting: “Where are you? Are you OK?”Kindertransport survivors on today's child refugees Read moreFinally, on 3 January, Nabi received a text from Masud’s phone. The lorry carrying the teenager had been pulled over by police outside Dunkirk ferry port. Inside the authorities made a grisly discovery. The young Afghan had suffocated and died.The tragedy – the first known refugee death in northern France this year – has prompted anguish over the government’s approach towards unaccompanied children in Calais. And the pain of those who knew Masud is deepened by the knowledge that he was about to become a test case. He had left Sweden for Calais in September in an attempt to be reunited with his sister. That meant he had a right to enter Britain.Under a clause in the EU’s Dublin Regulation covering hearing of asylum claims, refugees who have close family members in a particular EU country can claim asylum there. But according to campaigners, the Home Office has in numerous cases chosen to ignore that right. Masud was among a group of children listed in a legal challenge against the Home Office that will be heard in London on 18 January. Lawyers had handpicked the young Afghan as one of the most desperate cases in Calais – a vulnerable and lonely child who deserved to be urgently reunited with a family member.“Masud was a 15-year-old boy in need of protection, a boy in need of his sister here in the UK,” said the Bishop of Barking, Peter Hill, a spokesperson for campaign group Citizens UK. “Every single night, desperate children are climbing into lorries and jumping on to train tracks to try and reach their families. Our government must act to honour its obligations and help these children.”On Saturday, Citizens UK launched an online petition demanding that David Cameron act to stop more teenagers from dying as they attempt to reach their relatives. Shadow immigration minister Keir Starmer, who visited the Jungle on Friday, announced that he would be writing to the home secretary, Theresa May, on Monday, asking why pledges she made last year to implement the Dublin Regulation and help the most vulnerable migrants – unaccompanied children – had led to so little action on the ground.Aid charities have reported a surge in the volume of unaccompanied youngsters living in tents in Calais with no support from the French state. Others warn they are vulnerable to traffickers, describing the child protection issues as enormous. “We are aware that there is an increasing trend for unaccompanied minors to be facilitated into and across the EU,” a Europol spokesman said, adding that about 7,000 had been reported among the flow of refugees – a figure they said was rising.Liz Clegg, who runs an independent women’s and children’s hospital in the Jungle, estimates that there are hundreds of unaccompanied children in the camp at any given point. An estimated 1,600 were registered by child protection agencies in France during 2015, although the true figure is certainly greater because most unaccompanied minors avoid the authorities.To date there has been no attempt to count the actual numbers of children gathered in northern France, although a French NGO, Trajectoires, will begin a census this month. Last Tuesday, a committee of MPs urged the UK to resettle 3,000 unaccompanied children from Syria, in addition to the 20,000 refugees it has already agreed to accept.Provisional work to identify Jungle migrants who have a clear legal right to live in Britain under the Dublin Regulation has tentatively identified 200, scores of them unaccompanied children.Advertisement“They all have the right to transfer their claim to Britain, so what is going on? It’s disgusting,” said Clegg. Charities warn that many unaccompanied minors simply disappear from the Jungle, often mysteriously. “We’ve even had siblings who don’t know where the other has gone,” added Clegg. “Sometimes we never hear of them again.”Of the seven refugees who once shared a tent with Masud and Nabi, four are believed to have made it to England, one is in Paris, the youngest is dead and Nabi remains in the Jungle.Elizabeth Fraser, whose charity Miracle Street provides a generator for refugees to use in the Jungle, said: “So many unaccompanied children seem to go missing. I remember once there were three Afghan brothers aged 10, 13, 16, and after a few days they also went. Nobody knows where to.”Sixteen-year-old Tarek, from Syria, was last seen walking from the Jungle towards the port of Calais on 28 December and has not been seen since. Fraser has tried calling to no avail, although she knows that the phones her charity dispenses to the young are frequently stolen by older men in the Jungle, or confiscated by police.Videos of Tarek shot by Fraser shortly before the teenager went missing show him struggling to cope with his situation: at one point he sobs uncontrollably when his family are mentioned.Unaccompanied children are particularly vulnerable to the French police’s routinely aggressive approach to the Calais refugees. Every unaccompanied child the Observer spoke to testified to alleged police brutality. All claimed to have had either pepper sprays, water cannon or truncheons used on them. Khalid al-Bai’aa, 16, from Egypt, described a bloody head wound caused by a blow from police. Hossam, 13, from Alexandria in Egypt, who has been in the Jungle since September, said: “I’ve been pepper sprayed in the face which is very painful: the police cause me many problems.” His friend Mahmoud, 17, also from Alexandria, whom he met in Calais, showed a blemish on his eyelid that he claimed was caused by pepper spray.Within the camp, the young and unaccompanied find themselves at the bottom of a hierarchy of bullying from groups of older males. Bai’aa described waking to find his tent slashed open and his rucksack and clothes stolen. On another occasion he was mugged.Intimidation is rife, said Mahmoud. “Even in the lines queuing for food groups say bad things at me and swear. Once they scratched my face.”There are other challenges, too. Bai’aa has been constantly ill since arriving four months ago; throughout the interview he clutched a bottle of chest medicine.“It’s cold and wet and health is a major issue. We’ve had a few in hospital with pneumonia,” said Clegg. Fraser added: “The cold gets into your bones and there’s no way to warm up. The faces of the children are turning grey. Their eyes are red and sunken.” Many complain they barely get enough to eat.Yet their desperation to get to England remains unquenchable. Hossam makes an attempt to climb on board a truck most days, and once spent 24 hours lying motionless inside a lorry before the police found him. Tonight he’ll go again, risking the same fate as Masud.",51.04214,2.37403,Dunkirk,France,Guardian Un./Mail Online,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jan/09/calais-jungle-child-refugees-uk-asylum,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3768,Geert,07/06/2017,Entry Nihan,06/03/2017,listofdeathsresearch

Die Guardia Civil hatte sie schon zuvor auf der marokkanischen Seite lokalisiert und das marokkanische Militär informiert, die dann mit heftiger Gewalt die Migranten und Flüchtlinge abzuhalten versuchten (die Zahl der Aufgehaltenen liegt anscheinend bei über 200). Bei den Auseinandersetzungen und beim EU-Zaun-Ueberklettern gab es viele Verletzte, die dann zusammen mit allen, die an Land nicht vorankamen, es per Schwimmen versuchten. Das war insbesondere fuer Verletzte mit Knochenbrüchen und schweren Wunden lebensgefährlich. (Ob unabhängig davon von Anbeginn auch andere versuchten, schwimmend rüberzukommen, ist aus den Artikeln nicht zu erkennen.)Die, die das EU-Zaun-Ueberklettern geschafft hatten, versammelten sich auf einem grenznahen Felsen und weigerten sich, sich in die Hände der wartenden Guardia Civil zu begeben. Inzwischen waren viele Menschen, auch vom Roten Kreuz und wohl auch von NGOs, angekommen. Schliesslich sicherte die Guardia Civil zu, dass es für diese keine Rückschiebungen („heisse Abschiebungen“) geben wird – sonst gängige illegale Praxis des spanischen Staats an den EU-Aussengrenzen der spanischen Enklaven Ceuta und Melilla). Die Zaunkletterer wurden später in den Einrichtungen Ceutas von anderen Migranten und Flüchtlingen begeistert empfangen. Marokkanische Medien berichten von 100 Rückschiebungen.In der Nacht haben 182 Migranten und Flüchtlinge es geschafft, über die Grenze nach Ceuta zu kommen. Unter ihnen sind 12 Verletzte, die ins Krankenhaus gebracht wurden. Zwei Flüchtlinge aus Kamerun ertranken, drei wurden von Hilfe-Spezialeinheiten der Guardia Civil gerettet. – Andere Berichte sprechen von 9 Toten. Über die genaue Zahl der Migranten und Flüchtlinge, die von marokkanischem Militär und Hilfstruppen aufgehalten wurden, die auf marokkanischer Seite verletzt wurden, liegen keine genauen Informationen vor.

The refugees told the officials that there were 41 people on board of the vessel.The search would continue for the time being, the officials added.Backed by two Coast Guard boats and two helicopters, the search team found the dead bodies. Dive teams were dispatched to the scene after survivors spoke of other refugees in the closed cabin of the semi-submerged vessel. Just hours earlier, the Coast Guard had rescued the Syrian refugees stranded at sea when the engine of their rubber boat broke down.Turkey's four Aegean provinces of Çanakkale, İzmir, Muğla and Aydın, which face the Greek islands, are prime spots for refugees leaving Turkey for EU countries. Over the past year, thousands have made the short but perilous journey across the Aegean Sea in a bid to reach Northern and Western Europe. Worsening weather conditions in winter makes the trip even more dangerous.According to the latest data from the International Organization for Migration (IOM), more than 801,000 refugees reached Europe via the Aegean Sea to Greece from Turkey, accounting for 80 percent of the refugees arriving illegally in Europe by sea in 2015. The IOM's death toll of refugees dying en route to Europe on the Aegean Sea was 706 as of Dec. 18, excluding the latest casualties. On Tuesday, 11 migrants, including three children, drowned when a boat carrying 18 capsized off Kuşadası, a town in Aydın, as they were heading to the Greek island of Samos.According to the U.N. refugee agency, more than 950,000 people have reached Europe by sea this year. Europe faces the largest refugee influx in its recent history due to aggravated conflict in Syria, deteriorating security in Iraq and Afghanistan and other challenges in Asian countries, which have forced millions to leave their homes.Turkey is home to more than 2.4 million Syrians. Though many prefer to stay in the country, either in refugee camps near the country's border with Syria or in houses they bought or rented across the country, a significant number of Syrians also seek shelter in Europe. With strict controls on Turkey's land borders with Greece and Bulgaria, sea is the only viable route for migrants as the coast lies only a few miles away from the Greek islands that dot the Aegean Sea. Syrians, along with Iraqis, Afghans and refugees from other countries, depart from secluded spots on the long coast stretching for more than 2,000 kilometers, from Çanakkale in the north to Muğla in the south. Their journeys are often cut short either due to malfunctioning boats or overcrowding that leads to the sinking of their dinghies. Weather, worsened by the onset of winter, also contributes to the heightened death toll in the dangerous waters of the Aegean.According to numbers reported by the media, 88,897 migrants were intercepted by the Coast Guard this year, a 650 percent rise compared to 2014. The majority of ""illegal passages"" to the Greek islands are by rubber boats, as they are cheaper and easier to obtain than wooden boats. Refugees are guided by human smugglers on their journeys and pay substantial sums to smugglers for the crossings. Turkish authorities nabbed 181 smugglers this year, though it is estimated that a higher number of smugglers evaded authorities as they often flee once they accompany the refugees to departure points.",39.075143,26.750336,Aegean Sea,Turkey,DailySabah/AA/AP/Irish Times,https://www.dailysabah.com/turkey/2015/12/24/refugee-boat-sinks-off-turkeys-western-coast-20-dead,20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20,,,,,,20,,,,,,,,,,,,,3801,Klara,07/06/2017,Entry Nihan,07/03/2017,listofdeathsresearch

His injury sparked violent protests in the border area among those waiting to cross.More than 5,000 people of various nationalities are in the Idomeni border area.At least two more people have been injured in the clashes, which have now continued for several days.Scuffles were breaking out intermittently between groups of mainly Iranians and Pakistanis on the one hand, and groups of mainly Afghans on the other, with both sides throwing rocks.At least two men were seen with bloodied heads from the rock-throwing.Greek riot police have been deployed in the area, forming a barrier to protect refugees waiting in a field on the Greek side to cross the border. Greece has also sent two trains to the area to provide transport back to the capital for migrants who cannot cross and wish to return to Athens. Volunteers were handing out fliers in several languages to the waiting crowd informing of the trains.Migrants from Pakistan, Iran and other countries not allowed to cross into the country have set up roadblocks near the border, preventing refugees from crossing.Groups of migrants used empty barrels, pieces of wood and metal to make a barrier about 400ft-long from the Greek-Macedonian border and are stopping all Syrians, Afghans and Iraqis from entering the area.A refugee camp set up in the area was looted of food and water during the melee.'Why aren't they allowing us to cross?' asked Eli, a 30-year-old Pakistani who has been living in Greece for six years and said he wanted to go on to Germany.'We're waiting until they open [the border]. Why is there this discrimination going on? The border must either open for all or close for all.'Meanwhile, Hungary's prime minister said the country is filing a lawsuit against the EU objecting to a mandatory plan to distribute migrants among members of the bloc.Viktor Orban said the suit would be today at the European Court of Justice. The EU is looking redistribute 120,000 asylum seekers already in the bloc among its 28 countries.Parliament last month approved legislation obliging the government to challenge the EU quotas, while Orban has repeatedly said that Brussels overstepped its authority when it approved the scheme despite opposition from a handful of mainly Eastern European countries.Serbia's prime minister has urged a joint international effort to solve the migrant crisis, warning that xenophobia and fear of extremists have been on the rise since the Paris attacks that killed 130 people.Aleksandar Vucic said at the opening Thursday of a ministerial conference of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that the meeting should come up with joint conclusions and recommendations.Vucic said 'hundreds of thousands of migrants' have passed through Serbia and other countries on the so-called Balkan corridor. He adds that 'fear exists of (infiltration) of foreign terrorist fighters who joined the war in Syria and Iraq and that fear has been rising, along with xenophobia.'",40.954493,21.906738,Idomeni,Greece,Mail Online/Reu./AFP/DW/Sky,http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3344513/Moroccan-electrocuted-climbing-train-carriage-Greece-s-border-Macedonia-stopped-allowing-economic-migrants-entering-country.html,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,3811,Klara,08/06/2017,Entry Nihan,08/03/2017,listofdeathsresearch

Deux Camerounais auraient trouvé la mort, asphyxiés dans une grotte, après que les forces de l’ordre marocaines ont incendié leur campement. Deux ressortissants camerounais sont morts lundi 30 novembre lors d’une opération d’évacuation d’un campement de migrants dans la ville de Fnideq, au Maroc, à 7 kilomètres de Ceuta. Selon des migrants qui ont été témoins de la scène, les deux jeunes s’étaient cachés dans une grotte pour fuir les agents marocains. Mais lors de l'intervention, les forces de l’ordre - la police ou des auxiliaires de l’armée, selon les sources - auraient mis le feu à des matelas et des couvertures à l’entrée de la grotte, sans vérifier si celle-ci était bien vide. Piégés par les flammes, les deux jeunes seraient alors morts asphyxiés. Pierre est un migrant camerounais qui vit dans un campement de fortune dans la forêt de Fnideq. Lundi, il a été témoin de l’intervention de police. Pour lui, il s’agit bien d’une bavure. ""On les surnommait Vapeur et Le Bire, ils avaient 23 et 24 ans""Nous avons l’habitude que les forces de l’ordre viennent dans notre camp pour tenter de nous expulser. Dimanche, personne n’est venu, nous avons baissé la garde. Mais lundi matin, nous avons été pris par surprise. Quand la police est arrivée, deux jeunes sont partis se cacher dans une petite grotte. La police a l’habitude de brûler les affaires que nous laissons derrière nous… ils ont donc mis le feu aux matelas et aux couvertures qui étaient à l’entrée de la grotte. Je suis sûr et certain qu’ils ont vu les deux jeunes entrer dans la grotte. Le site internet Ceutaldia est allé vérifier la présence des corps dans la grotte.""Ceux qui sont allés informer la police ont été arrêtés et expulsés""Il y a eu beaucoup de fumée et une odeur étrange… Quand la police est partie, je suis entré dans la grotte, j’ai mis un chiffon sur mon nez et j’ai essayé de voir ce qu’il y avait à l’intérieur. C’est là que j’ai vu un corps… J’ai directement fait demi-tour. On m’a ensuite dit qu’il n’y avait pas un mais deux corps. Les deux jeunes qui sont décédés se surnommaient  ""Vapeur"" et ""Le Bire"", ils avaient 23 et 24 ans. Mardi matin, huit migrants présents dans la forêt se sont rendus au poste de police pour les informer de la situation. Ils se sont tous faits arrêter pour être expulsés... Dans l’après-midi, la police et les secours sont revenus en forêt. Je me suis à nouveau caché. Certains migrants m’ont dit que la police les a accusés d’avoir eux-mêmes fait un feu devant la grotte et donc d’avoir tué leurs propres camarades. Je n’y crois pas. Notre observatrice Helena Maleno est bénévole dans l’association espagnole ""Caminando fronteras"" basée près de Tanger. Depuis quelques mois, elle observe une augmentation des violences policières contre les migrants. ""Même la population locale ne supporte plus les violences faites aux migrants""Plusieurs migrants, témoins de l’intervention de police qui a coûté la vie à deux jeunes, nous ont appelés. Tous ont raconté la même histoire. Pour le moment, il est impossible de savoir s’il s’agit d’un accident ou pas, mais ils disent que les deux migrants sont morts asphyxiés dans la grotte. Selon certains témoins, il ne s’agirait pas de la police mais des forces auxiliaires (militaires). Ce qui est sûr, c’est que les violences policières lors des expulsions ne se passent pas seulement en forêt ! Elles se multiplient dans la région, près de Ceuta, et sont souvent très violentes. Cela fait quelques mois que l’on craint un dérapage. En plus c’est totalement incohérent… ici la population locale est prête à intégrer les migrants et ne supporte plus les violences qui leurs sont infligées.Ceuta, route de l’immigration africaineLa cellule de communication de la direction générale de la sûreté nationale marocaine nous a confirmé qu’une enquête était en cours, mais n’a pas souhaité nous donner plus de précisions. Le Maroc doit faire face à l’afflux de milliers de migrants. Le pays est l’une des principales routes de l’immigration africaine vers l’Europe, notamment à cause de ses frontières communes avec les enclaves espagnoles de Ceuta et Melilla. Dans la région de Tanger, de nombreux migrants campent illégalement dans les forêts qui bordent Ceuta en attendant de tenter leur chance vers l’Europe. Pour passer, plusieurs solutions périlleuses s’offrent à eux : escalader les hauts grillages qui bordent les enclaves, ou emprunter la voie maritime, parfois à la nage, pour contourner la barrière. En novembre dernier, pour l'émission Ligne Directe, nous avions rencontré dans un campement en forêt un migrant guinéen, Mamadou Diallo.

(4 babies, 3 chn, 5 women)",unknown,"drowned when boat capsized near Greek island of Samos; 15 rescued, 2 missing","On 1st November 2015, a boat capsized at the coast of Samos, a Greek island. 11 people drowned, including 5 women, 2 toddlers and 4 babies. 15 people were rescued, but an unknown number of people were still missing.That Sunday, the weather was terrible with winds of 50 km/h, and the Greek coastguard did not allow ships to sail in most of the country’s ports. However, this did not stop smugglers in Turkey to force migrants on board, allegedly they simply make them pay a lower fee in bad weather conditions.---Sunday 1 November 2015 19.47 GMT Last modified on Thursday 9 February 2017 12.46 GMTThe crisis unfolding on Europe’s southern periphery deepened on Sunday as the Greek coastguard announced that another 11 refugees, most of them infants, had died in their desperate attempt to reach the west – their deaths adding to the ever growing toll at sea.Pitiful images of rescue workers recovering babies from the cabin of a six-metre boat were played out off the Aegean island of Samos after a vessel capsized in stormy weather as it made the perilous crossing from Turkey. “We recovered 11 drowned bodies, 10 of which were trapped inside the boat’s cabin,” one coastguard official was quoted as saying. Four babies, two children and four women were among the dead.The body of a girl who had fallen out of the the vessel was later washed up on the shores of the island. Fifteen other people were saved. A search and rescue operation was under way late on Sunday to try to locate two more people missing from the boat.More than 50 people are now known to have died attempting to reach Greece in the past five days. The vast majority are described as Syrian refugees, most of them women and children braving winter storms in a bid to meet men who made the journey earlier.More than 570,000 migrants bound for Europe have cross ed Greece’s borders this year, almost all of them arriving from neighbouring Turkey in flimsy, unseaworthy dinghies. The influx of people by land and sea has become the largest movement of refugees and migrants since the second world war.The worsening situation in Syria and tumult elsewhere in the Middle East has steadily increased the flow of people defying worsening weather to risk the treacherous voyage.The drownings have cast an unflattering light on Europe’s immigration policies and the slow pace at which EU leaders have moved to deal with the emergency. After 22 people drowned in two separate incidents on Friday, the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, accused the continent of an “inability to defend its values” by offering a safe alternative to the dangerous sea journeys. The boat from which the 11 refugees’ bodies were recovered. Photograph: Alexis Malagaris/APTsipras will visit Lesbos, the Aegean island that has borne the brunt of the influx, with the president of the European parliament, Martin Schulz, later this week.Arrivals on Lesbos surged to more than 125,000 in October, double the figure for August.Aid organisations and the army of volunteers who have rushed to the Greek islands have increasingly joined the chorus of criticism, with one speaking of “an abomination against humanity”. Rescue workers who confronted the recent drownings off Lesbos have been visibly shocked. They say Greece, which is going through its worst economic crisis in modern times, is unable to deal with the influx alone.“The world has aid organisations, but it is simply not doing enough,” said Mona Martinsen, a Norwegian paramedic on Lesbos. “What the west is doing is a drop in the ocean. It’s not right. They have to come here and help.”The International Rescue Committee, which has sent a team to Lesbos, said the lack of support from Europe was hampering relief efforts, with the response all too often left to charities and volunteers. Many refugees are forced to survive without shelter, food and other basic items as a result.“These terrible drownings will not be the last, unless there is a quantum shift in the breadth and depth of European effort,” said David Miliband, the IRC president and former British foreign secretary. “Prime minister Tsipras is right to speak of European shame. Now we need European action.”Greece has agreed to put up as many as 50,000 refugees until they are relocated to other non-border countries.As the crisis intensified over the summer, Athens began transporting refugees by bus to the northern frontier Greece shares with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in a bid to ease flows and allow them to continue their journeys through the Balkans into central Europe.Bulgaria’s interior ministry announced on Saturday that 120 people, most of them believed to be from Syria, had been discovered in a refrigerated truck on the country’s border with Turkey. A spokeswoman said 38 men, 33 women and 58 children were found hidden behind bottles of water at the border crossing of Kapitan Andreevo. Their state of health was not a cause of concern, she said. The lorry driver was arrested.In August, 71 people were found dead in a refrigerated lorry designed to carry frozen food after traffickers abandoned the vehicle in Austria.Smugglers working along the Turkish coast have reduced their prices in an effort to lure ever growing numbers of people to make the perilous crossing to Greece.",37.746829,27.117004,Samos,Greece,Guardian Un./VK,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/01/bodies-of-11-refugees-most-of-them-infants-recovered-off-greece,12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,12,,,,,,12,,,,,,,,,,,,,3401,Klara,09/06/2017,New Entry,08/03/2017,Klara

Y es que aunque de momento solo se han podido localizar unos pocos cadáveres -cuatro al cierre de esta edición-, la cifra de desaparecidos tras el naufragio de una embarcación salida de Alhucemas (Marruecos) el pasado miércoles en el mar de Alborán asciende provisionalmente a 39 personas, entre ellos al menos dos bebés.Una de las supervivientes relató a sus rescatadores que la embarcación se «desfondó» durante la noche. A bordo, explicó la mujer, iban entre 54 y 55 personas. La mayoría de los ocupantes cayeron al agua «y se perdieron en el mar», contaron los inmigrantes. Solo se salvaron quienes pudieron agarrarse a la parte neumática de la lancha. Como muchos de los desaparecidos llevaban puestos chalecos salvavidas, desde los servicios de rescate no se pierde la esperanza de que alguno pueda seguir con vida.Los 15 supervivientes, 13 hombres y dos mujeres, llegaron ayer a media tarde al puerto de Málaga, donde fueron atendidos por los servicios sanitarios de Cruz Roja. Un portavoz de la organización confirmó que siete de ellos tuvieron que ser trasladados a un hospital de la capital al presentar síntomas de hipotermia, hipoglucemia y bajada de tensión, fruto del cansancio tras tantas horas de travesía y la tensión.Entre los hospitalizados se encontraban las dos mujeres que habían participado en la travesía, ambas además en estado de choque por no saber el paradero de sus bebés, uno de ellos de menos de un año. La situación de abatimiento por la suerte de sus compañeros la reflejaban algunos de los varones rescatados, con la mirada perdida mientras eran atendidos en el puerto.Todos eran de origen subsahariano, procedentes de Camerún, Nigeria, Costa de Marfil, Malí y Guinea, según informó una cooperante de la organización Caminando Fronteras, Helena Maleno. El resto de los ocupantes fueron conducidos a la comisaría de la Policía Nacional de Málaga para proceder a su identificación e iniciar los trámites de expulsión.Entre los escasos datos que han proporcionado los supervivientes destaca que llevaban tres días a la deriva. La propia Maleno explicó en las redes sociales que la embarcación había salido de una playa a dos kilómetros de Alhucemas durante el martes, y casi 24 horas después, comunicaron a sus familias que el «viaje no iba bien» por el mal estado del mar. Salvamento Marítimo confirmó que estos días atrás el Mediterráneo no ofrecía el mejor pronóstico para un viaje de estas características, con fuerte marejada y vientos de 20 nudos, que se tornaron a mar rizada con viento de ocho nudos en la jornada del jueves.AGARRADOS A LA ZODIACLa cooperante alertó de que la embarcación estaba a la deriva la tarde del miércoles, tras perder la comunicación con los inmigrantes. No fue hasta ya avanzada la mañana del jueves cuando el avión Cóndor-2 del servicio Frontex avistó la zodiac a 39 millas del nornoroeste de Alhucemas y a 52 millas de la costa de Málaga, en el mar de Alborán.El panorama con que se encontraron los miembros de Salvamento Marítimo al acercarse era terrorífico, con los inmigrantes flotando a duras penas agarrados al flotador de la lancha, lo único que quedaba de la embarcaciónMientras eran conducidos a puerto, los helicópteros empezaron a localizar los cadáveres del resto de desaparecidos, todos ellos varones adultos subsaharianos.

An estimated 14 people lost their lives, while 138 migrants have been rescued.On Friday (30/10) morning, Ms. Namia reported that three more migrants died from a shipwreck off the coast of Rhodes, but at least three more remain missing. Six migrants have been rescued.Deaths off the Greek islands, notably Lesvos and Samos, have surged with the cold weather setting in. IOM estimates 435 men, women and children have died on the Eastern Mediterranean route linking Turkey to Greece since October 6th.October 28th could be described as the deadliest day in these waters this year, with five fatal shipwrecks – two off Lesvos, another two off the coast of Samos, and one off Agathonisi.The worst incident was off the coast of Lesvos, when a wooden boat carrying from 300 – 500 migrants sank. It is unclear exactly how many people were on board. According to the testimonies of those rescued, the boat had two decks and when the upper deck collapsed, the boat immediately sank.The Hellenic Coast Guard and a Norwegian vessel, the Peter Henry Von Koss, rescued 242 people. Seven bodies (four children and three adults) were recovered. There is verified information that another 34 are missing, but the number may be much higher and the Hellenic Coast Guard is continuing search operations.The Peter Henry Von Koss, part of the Frontex-coordinated Operation Poseidon Sea, was the first to arrive at the scene and played an important role in the rescue operation, saving 120 of the 242 rescued migrants from the water.The same day, the Hellenic Coast Guard rescued a boat taking water off the coast of Lesvos’ Mithimna port. Two children – a boy aged 6 and a girl 3 aged 3 – were unconscious and one later died in a hospital on Lesvos. Some 71 people were rescued.The third incident happened off Agathonisi. According to the Hellenic Coast Guard based in Samos, 372 people reached the island after their boat capsized, but another three died and one infant went missing. That fourth victim’s corpse was found Friday morning, IOM’s team in Greece reported.Near Samos, Coast Guard units also rescued 52 people from an incident off the island’s Cape Gatou coast.  Authorities say another 3 people – believed to be from Syria and Afghanistan – died, with one infant still missing. Remains of the dead were removed to Leros.In yet another incident reported off Samos’ Agios Konstantinos port, some 47 people were rescued and 2 people remain missing. A 5 year-old Syrian girl later died in a nearby hospital.Because of the bad weather and the rough sea, IOM staffers say that sea searches have become increasingly difficult.Despite the severe and windy weather conditions, daily arrivals in Greece continue at high levels. Some 6,635 migrants crossed into Greece from Turkey on October 28th and 6,637 on October 27th.Meanwhile, 1,042 migrants were rescued at sea in the Channel of Sicily on Wednesday. Rescue operations were carried out by the Italian Coast Guard and Irish, British, German and Slovenian naval vessels. Migrants were rescued from 6 rubber dinghies and from a wooden fishing boat, which was carrying 439 people.The majority of rescued migrants have been transferred on the Norwegian ship Siem Pilot, which is expected to arrive in Reggio Calabria this morning (30/10), with 824 migrants on board. The remaining 218 migrants were brought yesterday to Lampedusa, where IOM staff reported that the main nationalities were Nigerian, Senegalese and Malian. Among the arrivals were several Nigerian women, who may be victims of human trafficking.“Sea conditions are deteriorating this time of year and the risk of shipwrecks is very high in the Channel of Sicily, where so far this year, 2,860 migrants have lost their lives. The work carried out by the ships patrolling the area is extremely efficient, as rescuing over 1,000 people at sea in just 24 hours is a very difficult and dangerous task,” said Federico Soda, Director of the IOM Coordination Office for the Mediterranean in Rome.

According to the Hellenic Coast Guard based in Samos, 372 people reached the island after their boat capsized, but another three died and one infant went missing. That fourth victim’s corpse was found Friday morning, IOM’s team in Greece reported.Near Samos, Coast Guard units also rescued 52 people from an incident off the island’s Cape Gatou coast.  Authorities say another 3 people – believed to be from Syria and Afghanistan – died, with one infant still missing. Remains of the dead were removed to Leros.In yet another incident reported off Samos’ Agios Konstantinos port, some 47 people were rescued and 2 people remain missing. A 5 year-old Syrian girl later died in a nearby hospital.Because of the bad weather and the rough sea, IOM staffers say that sea searches have become increasingly difficult.Despite the severe and windy weather conditions, daily arrivals in Greece continue at high levels. Some 6,635 migrants crossed into Greece from Turkey on October 28th and 6,637 on October 27th.Meanwhile, 1,042 migrants were rescued at sea in the Channel of Sicily on Wednesday. Rescue operations were carried out by the Italian Coast Guard and Irish, British, German and Slovenian naval vessels. Migrants were rescued from 6 rubber dinghies and from a wooden fishing boat, which was carrying 439 people.The majority of rescued migrants have been transferred on the Norwegian ship Siem Pilot, which is expected to arrive in Reggio Calabria this morning (30/10), with 824 migrants on board. The remaining 218 migrants were brought yesterday to Lampedusa, where IOM staff reported that the main nationalities were Nigerian, Senegalese and Malian. Among the arrivals were several Nigerian women, who may be victims of human trafficking.“Sea conditions are deteriorating this time of year and the risk of shipwrecks is very high in the Channel of Sicily, where so far this year, 2,860 migrants have lost their lives. The work carried out by the ships patrolling the area is extremely efficient, as rescuing over 1,000 people at sea in just 24 hours is a very difficult and dangerous task,” said Federico Soda, Director of the IOM Coordination Office for the Mediterranean in Rome.

26/10/2015,26/10/15,1,N.N. ,unknown,reportedly died from injuries sustained aboard a vessel near Greek island of Agathonisi,"28.10.2015 / 10:41 / Aegean SeaWatch The Med Alarm Phone Investigations – 26th of October 2015Case name: 2015_10_26-AEG110Situation: Traveller died after delayed rescue on the Greek islands of Agathonisi, 10 boats in distress rescued near Lesvos, Chios and SamosStatus of WTM Investigation: Concluded Place of Incident: Aegean SeaSummary of the Cases: On Monday the 26th of October 2015 the Alarm Phone dealt with a total of 11 emergency situations in the Aegean Sea. One traveller died after he and his group had stranded on the Greek islands of Agathonisi. The Greek coastguard rescued 6 boats in distress near Lesvos, Chios and Samos. Two groups of travellers arrived in Greece on their own and two were returned back to Turkey by the Turkish coastguard.At 0.30am a contact person informed us about a group of 23 travellers who had stranded on the Greek island of Agathonisi, among them 5 women, 3 children and one injured man who had lost consciousness (case 1). While establishing contact to the group was difficult in the beginning, with the help of an Arabic translator we were eventually able talk to the group directly at 1.50am. They confirmed the information we had received from our contact person and stated that they were in urgent need of medical assistance. They had already called the international emergency number 112 but no one had answered. Immediately afterwards, we alerted the port police on Agathonisi and on Patmos, who both refused to take notice of our information, because they were either not able to speak English or did not feel responsible for this case. Afterwards, we also informed the Greek police and the UNHCR in Greece via mail about the group in distress. In a call to the Greek police on Agathonisi we were told that they had already sent someone in order to rescue the group. During the following hours we continuously tried to get further information from several Greek authorities, among them the port authorities on Agathonisi and Patmos and the police on Agathonisi and Samos, but in most of the cases they did not reply or hang up promptly. However, at 8.20am the port authorities on Agathonisi told us, that they would send someone in order to rescue the group. At 9am we learned from another contact person who had talked directly to the travellers that the group was still on the same place and no help had arrived so far. We called the Agathonisi police station again and were told that they know about the group. At 11am another contact person informed us that someone had arrived at the group’s location and had evacuated one person, while the rest of the group was still waiting for help. At 11.20am, in another call to the police station on Agathonisi, we were told that the evacuation of the rest of the group had started. In the evening one of our contact persons and the travellers themselves informed us that they had been rescued but that the injured person had died in hospital.On the same day at 2.20am a contact person informed us about a boat in distress between Ismis/Turkey and the Greek island of Lesvos (case 2). Being exposed to heavy wind and high waves, water was already entering the boat. We received a phone number of the travellers on board but were neither able to reach them nor to find out about their current position. At 9.15am we talked again to the contact person and learned that the travellers were back in Turkey.At about 5am we were alerted to two boats in distress between Çeşme/Turkey and the Greek island of Chios with 43 and 50 travellers on board respectively (cases 3 + 4). We reached the first boat via WhatsApp and learned that their engine had stopped working, but that they are moving in the direction of Chios, due to the strong currents. We called the Greek coastguard in Piraeus at 5.50am and forwarded all our information. At 6.10am we were also able to speak directly to the travellers of the second boat and learned that they were exposed to very high waves and that waters was entering their boat as well. At 6.30 they provided us with their latest position. At 6.35 we informed the Greek coastguard about the latest positions of both boats via mail. At 8.30am we learned that the first boat had been rescued and in the evening of that day the contact person who had alerted us to the second boat also confirmed to us that this group had been rescued by the Greek coastguard at about 10am.At 6.30am we were informed via Facebook about a boat in distress near the Greek island of Samos (case 5). We established contact to the travellers via WhatsApp and learned that they were 55 persons on a damaged boat. They provided us with their latest coordinates and at 7.20am we alerted the Greek coastguard via phone and mail. Afterwards we were not able to get in contact with the travellers again. At 11.45am the Greek coastguard asserted to us that they had rescued the travellers. However, in the evening a contact person confirmed to us that the travellers had instead managed to arrive on the island of Samos on their own and that the Greek coastguard had not interfered.A contact person alerted us to a boat in distress close to Mytilini on the Greek island of Lesvos at 9.30am and provided us with several phone numbers (case 6). We sent a WhatsApp message to the travellers and called them at 9.40am. They told us that they had already arrived safely on Lesvos.In the afternoon we were alerted to three further boats in distress close to Lesvos. At 3.30pm a contact person informed us about a boat with 80 travellers on board, the engine of which had stopped north of Lesvos (cases 7). In a direct call to the travellers at 3.36pm we heard that the engine was already running again, but we were unable to obtain any further information. We alerted the Greek coastguard via phone and mail at 3.38pm and they promised to follow up the case. The contact person informed us at 5pm that the travellers were rescued and safe.At 4.10pm the same contact person informed us about another boat in this area, with 40 people on board (case 8). Again, we alerted the Greek coastguard via phone and mail and at 5pm our contact person confirmed to us that this boat was rescued as well.At 4.20pm someone called us directly from a boat in distress, with 50 travellers on board (case 9). The boat’s engine had broken down as well and we heard many people crying and shouting. As the travellers were not able to provide us with their current location, we asked them to call the emergency hotline 112. At 5pm we asked the Greek coastguard whether they had received a distress call from this boat, but they denied. At 5.40 we talked again to the travellers on the boat. This time communication was easier and we learned they had already been rescued and arrived on Lesvos.In the evening of that day we received another direct call form travellers in distress at 8.45pm (case 10). The travellers told us that they had already called the emergency number 158 but that no rescue had arrived so far. They did not know were they are but promised to send us their current position via WhatsApp. At 9.15pm we called them again as we had not received any further information. They told us that in this very moment they saw a rescue vessel approaching them. Afterwards we were not able to reach them again.Finally, at 9.40am a contact person alerted us to a boat in distress close to Chios, with 50 travellers on board (case 11). We immediately called the Greek coastguard and at 10pm our contact person told us that the travellers in distress saw a rescue vessel coming closer to them. At 10.10pm he confirmed to us that the Greek coastguard had rescued the travellers in distress.	Last update: 11:13 Nov 06, 2015",37.472197,27.007313,Aegean Sea,Greece,WatchTheMed,http://watchthemed.net/reports/view/320,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,3830,Geert,07/06/2017,Entry Nihan,09/03/2017,listofdeathsresearch

'Everything points to this being a hate crime.' As he launched his attack on the students, Lundin-Petterson, who was described by a witness as 'wearing a Darth Vader mask', shouted 'I am your father' during his killing spree, a witness has revealed.Hero: Witnesses have described how Mr Eskandar threw himself between the killer and students+20Hero: Witnesses have described how Mr Eskandar threw himself between the killer and studentsThe killer who posed for a photograph with unwitting students midway through his rampage, said the famous Star Wars character's line as he slashed at children.Earlier today, survivors praised the first victim of the attack - 20-year-old teaching assistant Lavin Eskandar, who was cut down after throwing himself in front of a group of young pupils.Witnesses say he screamed at the children to run before trying to overpower Lundin-Petterson who, armed with a sword and knife, went on to stab two 15-year-old students and a teacher.Several students who witnessed the attack at the school in Trollhättan have described Mr Eskandar as a hero who gave his life for them.Mr Eskandar had been sat by a computer in the school cafeteria when Lundin-Pettersson, wearing a black coat over his shoulders, a helmet and mask, raised his sword and went for a number of students.Witnesses have described how the brave 20-year-old threw himself between the killer and students to try to stop him.Mr Eskandar's family has paid tribute to him today, calling him 'a king and a hero in the eyes of the entire city.''All I know is that he cared about others, not about himself and that he tried to protect the children. He was the only person who succeeded in stopping the culprit,' his brother Leith Eskandar, 22, told Expressen. Mr Eskandar, who graduated from a local high school in June this year with a diploma in media studies, had recently begun working as an assistant to one of the students at Kronan school in Trollhattan.He dreamed of becoming a director and photographer and ran a production company with his brother and a friend, making videos that has millions of YouTube views.In addition he worked as a local night-club snapper and has been described by friends and family as dedicated, hard working and loved.Lundin-Petterson's second victim, Ahmed Hassan, 15, who died in hospital on Thursday afternoon, had arrived in Sweden with his parents and eight siblings from Somalia in 2012.The other student victim, also 15, had fled Syria with his family and arrived in Sweden nine months ago.He is currently in critical but stable condition and medical staff told Swedish media that the is no longer 'hovering between life and death'. A witness told Expressen that Lundin-Pettersson had uttered the phrase 'I am your father', in English as he attacked. Swedish police have now confirmed that the brutal attack was a racist hate crime and a terror attack.On Friday, at least two schools in Gothenburg, just 45 miles south of Trollhattan received threats in connection with the attack.Staff at one of them, Grevegårdsskolan, a primary school, found threatening posters when they arrived this morning.The posters show a picture from the attack on Thursday, although police have not revealed which one, captioned 'I'm back'. After cutting down Mr Eskandar, Lundin-Pettersson, moved through the school but before word had spread of the attacks, many students thought he had dressed up as a Halloween joke and approached him.Two young girls even asked him to pose for a picture, and despite having already murdered Mr Eskandar, Lundin-Pettersson paused to do so.  Wearing a mask and holding a sword already covered in Mr Eskandar's blood, the image sees him stand next to two young students, In a chilling move, Lundin-Petterson even has his arm around one of them, seconds before stabbing a teacher, who remains in critical condition.The anonymous girl who took the photograph told Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet that they had no idea that the blood on the large sword he was holding was real.She told the newspaper that she had left her classroom to fetch a pen when she spotted two friends standing with a man wearing a mask and holding a blood-covered knife.Thinking that the attacker had dressed up as a holiday joke, her friends wanted a picture with him, so she obliged.Seconds after the picture was taken, their teacher, a 41-year-old maths lecturer, came out of the classroom and told the killer to take off the mask and leave as he was scaring the children.'He just nodded, then he plunged the large knife into the teacher's right side.

Survivors said he made a wrong manoeuvre and a wave threw into the water those who were on the bow. Migrants told IOM staff that people on board begged to go back to rescue those floundering, but the smuggler refused.Some survivors told IOM that at least 20 fellow passengers now are missing; others pegged the figure at less than 10. Di Giacomo observed: “We have seen that lately rubber dinghies, which used to carry up to 100 or 110 people, now cram 130, sometimes 140, migrants on board.”",34.849875,12.678223,Mediterranean Sea,,IOM,http://www.iom.int/news/iom-monitors-migrant-arrivals-deaths-italy-greece-and-spain,15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,15,,,,,,,15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,15,,,,,,15,,,,,,,,,,,,,3398,Klara,05/06/2017,New Entry,08/03/2017,Klara

(4 chn, 8 women, 59 men)",Syria/Iraq/Afghanistan,"suffocated in back of truck found outside Parndorf (A), abandoned by traffickers","On 27 August 2015, 71 dead migrants were found near Parndorf (Austria) in the back of an abandoned truck at the side of a highway connecting Budapest to Vienna. A road worker noticed that liquids were dropping out of the truck and notified the police. The liquids were blood and body fluids from dozens of people found inside the truck. They were already in such a state of decomposition that it was at first hard to know how many bodies there were. After investigation it was found that there were 71, including 8 women and 4 children aged 18 months to 10 years. 29 were from Iraq - mainly Kurdish Iraq, including the towns of Dohuk and Zakho - 21 from Afghanistan, and 15 from Syria including from the town of Qamishly.All victims were identified except one. Most were repatriated to their countries, while a dozen have been buried at a Muslim cemetery in Vienna.The refrigerated Volvo truck was one of 13 sold by the Slovak chicken meat firm Hyza the year before. According to the Hungarian authorities, a Romanian citizen had registered it in the city of Kecskemet, eastern Hungary. Most probably, smugglers had transported the migrants from Hungary, but they died already before reaching Austria, and the smugglers abandoned the truck and left. The next day, the authorities announced that three suspects had been arrested, a Hungarian and two Bulgarians, one of them the owner of the truck, and that they might be part of an organized criminal network.Two years later, it was announced that 11 men (9 Bulgarians, an Afghan and a Lebanese) had been charged with human trafficking, and 4 of them also with murder, related to this case. They were an organized criminal network that had made at least 31 trips across the Hungary-Austria border between February and August 2015, transporting more than 1200 refugees and making hundreds of thousands of euros in the process. The gang leader was identified as the 30-year-old Afghan Lahoo Samsooryamal, who paid for the operation and organized the transports. A 31-year-old Bulgarian was the head of the human smuggling ring and its two Bulgarian drivers (one of whom is called Ivajlo S.). The drivers of the truck had heard bangs and cries from the migrants in the back, half an hour after departure, and reported the problem to the head of the organization, who ordered them not to open the door of the container hold. They complied with instructions, and after three hours left the truck on the A4 highway and returned to Hungary in the reconnaissance car. The following day, they smuggled another 67 migrants across the border, but these were able to kick down the door of the container hold, so no one died.The trial took place on June 21, 2017 in Kecskemet (Hungary), because authorities determined that the victims died in Hungary before reaching Austria. Nine of the suspects are in custody in Hungary and one in Bulgaria, while the 11th is at large. Szabolcs Sarkozy, a spokesman for the court, told AFP that ""hopefully"" there will be a verdict this year.In October 2017 the Daily Mail reported that 3 additional suspects have been indicted: a 26-year-old Afghan (said to belong to the organization’s leadership) and 33-year-old Bulgarian (a driver), who are at large, and a 34-year-old Bulgarian (thought to have recruited drivers for the smuggling operation) who is in custody.",47.990295,16.856883,Parndorf,Austria,DerStandard/Guardian/Reuters/VK/MNS/Vivre/Imkander/MailOnline/BBC/SunMY/USNews/Ya.N,http://derstandard.at/2000021404688/Polizei-veroeffentlicht-neue-Ermittlungsergebnisse-nach-Fluechtlingstragoedie-auf-A4,71,71,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,71,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,71,,,,,,,,,,,,,71,,,,,71,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3268,Dorien,26-04-2018,New Entry,27/08/2015,Jono

Many appeared to have been trapped in the hold when it capsized.According to a representative of Doctors Without Borders (MSF) who was helping to coordinate the humanitarian response, around 40 bodies were found inside a half-sunk fishing boat as it was brought towards the shore by the high tide. Up to 160 others were discovered floating nearby, while around 201 survivors were rescued. Some of the bodies were taken to shore, but many were left to float in the water overnight, as coastguards did not have enough light to work by.Those on board had been from sub-Saharan Africa, Pakistan, Syria, Morocco and Bangladesh, the security official said.If confirmed, the incident would bring the total number of deaths in the Mediterranean this year to over 2,500 – a figure higher even than last year’s record-breaking toll.Bodies of 50 migrants found in hull of boat rescued off Libyan coastRead moreOn Wednesday, 52 bodies were found below deck on a wooden boat with over 450 people on board rescued by the Swedish coast guard off the coast of Libya.

25/05/2015,25/05/15,1,"Osama (17, boy)",Morocco,fell from a cliff while trying to enter the Spanish enclave of Melilla from Morocco,"El lunes murió un chico. No hemos visto nada en las noticias. Ni políticos dando el pésame ni la opinión pública movilizándose. No era europeo, y esa es la única causa. Bueno no, la única no. También era pobre. Un nadie.Osama era un chico como cualquiera de los cientos que crecen hijos de una familia extensa, en duras condiciones, endurecidos y curtidos por los años de buscarse la vida en las calles de Fes, Marruecos. Como para la mayoría, la única salida a la miseria es una: llegar a Europa y buscarse un futuro. O por lo menos la oportunidad de tenerlo. El viaje es largo, y las posibilidades de triunfar mínimas. Pero vale la pena jugársela.Una de las rutas más codiciadas es también una de las más costosas: entrar en Melilla. El reino marroquí no reconoce la soberanía de los enclaves españoles en el Norte de África y se refiere a ellos como ""los presidios"", pues eso fueron durante casi cuatrocientos años: cárceles. Y a pesar de haber cambiado su estatus legal a través de los años, eso siguen siendo a ojos de cualquiera que cruce sus infranqueables muros. Melilla es una cárcel rodeada por una valla de 12 kilómetros.Es el sueño de miles de migrantes que esperan utilizarla como trampolín de entrada a Europa: malienses o sirios que escapan de la guerra, argelinos y otro sin fin de nacionalidades utilizan esta ruta cara al 'sueño Europeo'. Pero nadie quiere quedarse en Melilla, y una vez que entran, el presidio se convierte en una pesadilla para muchos.Esto es lo que ocurre con los menores del Rif, que cruzan el puesto habilitado de Beni Nzar, la grieta de la muralla, para acceder a Melilla. Algunos tienen solo ocho años. No tienen nada que perder. Cruzan corriendo la aduana perseguidos por los militares y la policía. Si los pillan tanto los policías españoles como los marroquíes les darán una paliza y los devolverán. Ellos volverán a intentarlo.Así es como entran decenas de jóvenes marroquíes a vivir en Melilla. Allí, y pese a lo que muchos quisieran, la legislación española impide expulsarlos por minoría de edad y la ciudad autónoma pasa a hacerse cargo de su tutela. Así es como entran en los centros de menores como ""La Purísima"". Este centro y muchos de sus trabajadores lleva siendo objeto de denuncias públicas y judiciales por parte de la ONG Pro Derechos de la Infancia de Melilla durante muchos años por diversos casos de maltrato, abusos, chantajes y corrupción sin que ninguna prospere. La ONG apunta a los dirigentes más altos de la Consejería de Interior de la ciudad autónoma como los culpables últimos de este trato degradante. Los centros de menores, mal abastecidos y desbordados de capacidad, son instrumentos de tortura. El mensaje debe ser claro: no sois bienvenidos.La reacción de los niños a los maltratos y a la falta de expectativas en Melilla es escaparse del centro y vivir en la calle. Se agrupan y callejean, construyen chabolas, esnifan pegamento para olvidar y viven de las limosnas de los vecinos. Otros duermen al raso. Todos rondan el puerto con el objetivo de hacer ""riski"", saltar al puerto y colarse en los barcos de carga que van a Málaga o Almería.La actitud de las autoridades siempre ha sido la misma: más policía y más criminalización. A veces los detienen y los devuelven al centro de menores, otras solo reciben golpes y vejaciones por parte de los agentes. Algunos chicos hablan incluso de devoluciones de menores a Marruecos realizadas por la policía ilegalmente.Desde hace unos meses la situación ha empeorado. La administración es conscientes de que no son capaces de gestionar el tema de los menores y la solución ha sido más mano dura. Se ha levantado una nueva valla en el acceso al puerto que da al acantilado para tratar de hacer imposible el acceso y la policía realiza redadas casi a diario. Quizás ha sido la proximidad de las elecciones lo que ha hecho que el alcalde Imbroda quiera borrar la mala imagen de niños durmiendo en las calles de Melilla y merodeando en el puerto.Por su parte, los jóvenes han encontrado otro acceso desde más lejos, rodeando el acantilado y exponiéndose al peligro aún más para acceder al puerto.Osama murió la noche del pasado lunes precipitándose al abismo delante de sus amigos. Sus compañeros, traumatizados, no saben qué pasará y si esta muerte traerá aún más desgracias a las ya existentes.La administración trata de desentenderse alegando que era mayor de edad y que no estaba por tanto bajo su tutela. En la ficha policial aparece como menor pero en la autopsia que acaban de realizar los médicos alegan que era mayor de edad. Pero no hay resultados concluyentes. La prueba que se realiza es el análisis óseo y el Defensor del Pueblo y varias organizaciones han denunciado ya la poca fiabilidad de estas prácticas, que tienen un margen de error de hasta cuatro años.El Delegado del gobierno, Abdelmalik El Barkani, ha incluso insinuado que es una fortuna que esto no ocurra más veces, dados los riesgos que corren estos chicos. Como si los chicos cruzaran acantilados por deporte. O como si la vida callejera de los menores no tuviera unas causas y unos culpables, con nombres y apellidos. Más allá de si el Estado era el tutor legal o no, la administración está directamente involucrada en esta trágica muerte, ya que no es más que la consecuencia última de sus medidas de acoso y represión a los jóvenes marroquíes.Y es esa fórmula, la violencia, la represión y exclusión, la que se aplica de forma sistemática contra todo los no-europeos desde este continente. La misma política que coloniza, devasta y saquea países y luego no se hace responsable del desastre humano que deja atrás. La misma que deja ahogarse a miles de personas de una tacada en el mar mientras se vanagloria de ser respetuosa con los derechos humanos.Unas políticas que reaccionan levantando obstáculos a las necesidades humanas.

At least 40 people were thought to have died.The survivors told the charity Save the Children that people drowned after jumping into the water when the rubber boat began losing air.Survivors, including two children as young as five years old, were saved by a container vessel, the Zeran, which had been sent to the area by Italian search and rescue authorities.The testimony appeared to be corroborated by dramatic video footage obtained by The Associated Press which showed migrants desperately jumping out of a deflating rubber dinghy and clambering up ropes and ladders on the side of the Zeran.The crew of the merchant vessel threw life saving rings down to the migrants, some of whom emptied fuel from jerry cans in order to use them as floats.Amid panic on board the dinghy, a crew member of the Zeran could be heard urging the migrants to keep calm, yelling ""Easy, easy!""

The latest rescue operation comes as smugglers take advantage of calm weather to send ships full of migrants across the Mediterranean Sea.The rescue operators picked up the migrants from wooden and rubber boats in 17 separate operations using Italian and French ships, the BBC reported, adding that an Italian ship landed nearly 900 migrants in Sicily early on Monday. The total number of people rescued is likely to rise as many more migrants are expected to cross the sea.In another incident on Sunday, three migrants died and 31 were rescued when a boat heading toward Europe sank off Egypt's coast, the Egyptian state media reported.In one of the incidents on Sunday, authorities rescued 311 people, including 16 children, who were saved from a fishing boat in the smugglers' fleet, the Associated Press (AP) reported, adding that the Italian Coast Guard was aided by a tug and merchant ship.In 2014, more than 170,000 people illegally crossed the Mediterranean and more than 3,200 died in the attempt.

23/04/2015,23/04/15,14,N.N. (20-30y),Somalia/Afghanistan,killed by train near Veles (MK) while walking on narrow mountain pass to Hungary,"A group of migrants trying to reach European opportunity via what's billed by smugglers as a ""safe"" route — trekking along train tracks through the Balkans — was hit by an overnight train in a remote river gorge in Macedonia, killing 14.The deaths of the undocumented migrants from Africa and Asia underscore how, even as tens of thousands risk drowning in the Mediterranean to reach European shores, many others gamble with their lives by taking perilous overland journeys to reach Hungary, a popular back door to the 28-nation European Union.Railway officials said many of those killed Thursday night had stopped to rest after an exhausting hourslong hike and were sleeping on the tracks when the train plowed into them.The overland route from Greece through Macedonia and Serbia has soared in popularity over the past two years as migrants seek a less dangerous path than the sea crossing from North Africa to Italy.Trains killed 40 migrants last year, usually in groups of one or two, compared to the more than 1,300 lives lost in the Mediterranean over the past three weeks alone — a horrifying statistic that has put 2015 on track to be the deadliest year ever for the sea crossing.Route includes narrow bridges, long tunnelsThe Balkans smuggling route follows railway lines through most of the 200-kilometre hike through Macedonia, and authorities say it was only a question of time before so many trekkers would die in a single train accident.The rail line includes narrow wooden bridges and two long tunnels through mountains that can leave migrants trapped with no way of escape, as well as frequent riverside bends that conceal the sight and sounds of oncoming trains.At the time that the train struck the group of migrants, they were resting and sleeping on the tracks.- Nikola Kostov, Macedonian RailwaysThursday's accident occurred around 10:30 p.m. on a narrow stretch of tracks sandwiched between the Vardar River and a steep slope. The express train from Thessaloniki, Greece, to the Serbian capital of Belgrade was about 10 kilometres northwest of the central Macedonian town of Veles when the train's engineer spotted a group of about 100 migrants on the tracks in the dark, 100 meteres ahead.The Macedonian stretch of the migrant route includes narrow bridges, long tunnels and blind corners. Trains often don't signal their arrival in wooded unpopulated areas. (Ognen Teofilovski/Reuters)""At the time that the train struck the group of migrants, they were resting and sleeping on the tracks,"" said Macedonian Railways manager Nikola Kostov. ""The train driver honked and tried to stop, but it was too late, and the train hit the group of migrants who weren't able to leave the tracks.""Kostov said the train was observing the local speed limit and described the stretch of track as ""dangerous and unapproachable"" for pedestrians.Though Kostov did not give a precise speed, the schedule shows that the train does not typically travel quickly, taking more than 14 hours to cover 645 kilometres, averaging just 45 km/h.Somalis, Afghans among the deadAuthorities said the 14 dead appeared to be mostly Somalis and Afghans in their 20s, though other details remained uncertain — not surprising, given that migrants often travel without IDs to complicate deportation efforts if caught. Somalis and Afghans are among the top nationalities using the Balkans route, along with Syrians fleeing civil war in their homeland.Those who died are believed to have been Somalis and Afghans. (Petr Stojanovski/Associated Press)Police detained nine migrants who remained at the scene Friday morning and questioned them about what happened and the identities of the dead. They said survivors described clambering up rocky slopes or clinging to bushes on the riverbank to escape the train.The Veles prosecutor, Slavica Temelkovski, said the detained migrants were mostly relatives or friends of the dead and had identified themselves and the victims as being from Somalia and Afghanistan.Tentative plans were put in place to bury the dead Saturday at the Muslim cemetery in Veles on the presumption that, barring authentication to the contrary, all came from predominantly Muslim countries.""This city is in disbelief,"" said Veles Mayor Slavco Cadiev. He said Veles residents over the past year had grown used to seeing hundreds of migrants pass through the town at once, usually sticking close to the rail lines.Difficult stretch of months-long journeyVeterans of the Balkans route have told The Associated Press that following the train tracks in Macedonia is one of the most nerve-racking parts of what can be a months-long journey involving detentions and deportations back to Greece to start the journey over.West African migrants sit exhausted after a night of heavy rain and hail that destroyed their tents near Gradsko, Macedonia. The tide of hopeful migrants pours through 'back-door' countries like Macedonia in the hope of entering the wealthier nations of the European Union. (Dalton Bennett/AP)Smugglers usually instruct migrants to travel the tracks at night, despite the increased risk of being hit by trains, because they are less likely to be spotted by authorities in the darkness.For many, the Balkans route starts in Turkey, where migrants pack into small boats that are often piloted by migrants themselves and abandoned once they reach the nearest Greek island. That journey, because of overcrowding and the inexperience of boat operators, is often the most dangerous part of the journey — a reality underscored this week when a wooden trawler carrying about 90 migrants broke up as it ran aground on the Greek island of Rhodes, killing three on board, including a boy.Trains don't give advance noticeSince February, the AP has followed a group of 45 West African migrants using the Balkans route. As they gathered at the Macedonian border in March, a smuggler warned they could easily be killed by a train if they didn't break up into small groups with a spotter at the front and the back, to shout alerts to the others.When you're on the tracks, you're afraid all the time.- Hamed Kouyate, migrant from Ivory CoastWhen walking at night on the tracks, migrants say, it can be hard to distinguish the wooden ties from stony gaps, never mind tell where the river is and how steep the falls might be on either side. Painful dives and tumbles into mud or gravel to avoid trains are common.""When trains come, they don't honk. It's woods. There's nobody there,"" said Hamed Kouyate, an 18-year-old from Ivory Coast who completed the Balkans route this month after a two-week trek, a brief police detention and other setbacks.Kouyate said all members of his group struggled to see in the often moonless night, and many suffered injuries from falls. He said they often were slow to react to trains because of mental and physical exhaustion. At one point, he said, one woman with an injured foot had to be pushed by others out of the way of an oncoming train.""When you're on the tracks, you're afraid all the time,"" he said in a telephone interview from France, where he arrived this week.""You're afraid because from one minute to the next, there might be a train.""",41.716456,21.772297,Veles,Macedonia,VK/MNS/ZEIT/ClandestinE/CBC/Imkander,http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/migrants-to-europe-14-people-struck-killed-by-train-in-macedonia-1.3046983,14,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,14,,,,,,,,,,14,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,14,,,,,,,,,,,14,,,,,,,14,,,,,,,,,,,,3235,Klara,06/06/2017,New Entry,10/06/2015,Till

They included all the women (some pregnant) and children on board. The initial death toll was believed to be 700, but it rose to 845 a year later. Only 28 people survived and only 58 bodies were initially found, which were buried in Malta. Hundreds of passengers had been locked in the hold when the vessel departed. The migrants were from Algeria, Egypt, Syria, Sudan, Guinea, Nigeria, Zambia, Ghana, Mali, the Gambia, Sierra Leone, Bangladesh, Senegal, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, Somalia and Eritrea. The sunken boat was located by the Italian navy 2 weeks later at a depth of 375 m. Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi announced that it would be recovered.More than a year later, in July 2016, the Italian marine announced that they had recovered 675 bodies from the sunken ship, 458 of which were in the hold, much more than initially thought. They were brought to Sicily for identification, and their fingerprints, DNA samples and distinguishing body marks were collected on file. The first burial of victims happened a week after the start of the recovery operation, with 13 bodies buried at a funeral in Catania, Sicily. According to an article, the 458 “bodies” were actually body bags in which there could be many different bodies. All bodies were badly decomposed after a year, half of them were only skeletons, making identification extremely hard.Before boarding the boat, passengers had to wait in an old building near Tripoli for weeks. They had to fully obey the traffickers, they were beaten, and some died of hunger before the journey even started. Traffickers forced them on board armed with sticks. The more they had paid, the higher they were allowed to be in the boat. Those paying the least were locked in the hold. Two of the survivors were smugglers, a Syrian, Mahmoud Bikhit, and a Tunesian, Mohammed Ali Malek who was the captain. According to survivors, he had been smoking weed and drinking. He drove the boat straight to the vessel and it accelerated at the last moment, causing it to smash into it three times, and causing it to capsize. The captain seems to have wanted to flee from or avoid the vessel, according to one of the survivors that might have been because he had seen that the rescuers were not Italian (they were in fact Philippino). After the tragedy he faced charges of multiple homicide and got 18 years of prison. His Syrian helper Bikhit got 5 years. They also had to pay 9 million euros each in compensation.There has never been such a big disaster in the Mediterranean since 1855 when 700 people perished in a transport of French troops near the Lavezzi islands. After what happened, the budget of the Frontex Triton mission, which had been much smaller than that of its predecessor Mare Nostrum, was tripled. The King Jacob changed its name (as such vessels often do) to MSC Isabelle. The journalists of French journal XXI found some of the survivors: one sells souvenirs to tourists in Sicily; two have been given a place to live with other migrants by the Italian social services and dream of going to Germany or Sweden; one lives close to Milan, sells things and distributes advertisements in post boxes; six are in Pulia, some of them work harvesting vegetables.

(pregnant woman),Sub-Saharan Africa,died of exhaustion on boat that rescued 144 people from capsized vessel going (LY) to (IT),"ROM taz | Nach den Aussagen von Überlebenden hat sich vor der libyschen Küste erneut eine Tragödie ereignet. Die Zeugen, die von einem italienischen Schiff gerettet und in den Hafen von Reggio Calabria gebracht worden waren, sprachen von bis zu 400 Toten, die am Sonntag dem Untergang ihres Boots zum Opfer gefallen sein sollen. Nur knapp 150 Personen sollen überlebt haben.Italienische Schiffe bargen bisher neun Leichen. Und das Drama setzte sich an Bord des italienischen Marineschiffs „Orione“ fort: Eine junge, schwangere Frau starb völlig entkräftet, während zugleich eine andere Schwangere ihr Kind gebar.Den Mitarbeitern der Hilfsorganisation Save the Children berichteten die Geretteten auch von den Zuständen in den libyschen Lagern: Sie seien vier Monate lang in einer alten Sardinenfabrik gefangen gehalten und immer wieder misshandelt worden.Das Flüchtlingsboot kenterte offenbar, als seine Insassen einen Frachter erblickt hatten und die Menschen sich auf eine Seite des Decks drängten, wodurch der völlig überladene Kahn – so die Aussagen – das Gleichgewicht verloren hatte. Den Geretteten zufolge konnten die meisten Flüchtlinge, unter ihnen viele Kinder und Jugendliche, nicht schwimmen.8.500 Gerettete seit FreitagDas Boot ist eines der vielen, die in den letzten Tagen von der libyschen Küste aus in See gestochen sind. Allein seit Freitag wurden etwa 8.500 Menschen von Schiffen der italienischen Küstenwache und Marine sowie von Frontex-Einheiten aufgenommen und in italienische Häfen gebracht.Die Erwartung, dass die Ankunftszahlen 2015 noch einmal über dem Rekordjahr 2014 liegen könnten, wird zumindest bisher durch den aktuellen Trend bestätigt: Mit den in den letzten Tagen Eingetroffenen wurden seit Jahresbeginn 21.000 Bootsflüchtlinge gezählt. Und schon vor dem schweren Unglück vom Sonntag hatte die Zahl der Todesopfer auf dem Meer bei etwa 500 gelegen.Mittlerweile greifen lybische Schlepper auch zu den Waffen, um die von ihnen genutzten Kähne vor der Beschlagnahmung zu schützen. Dies berichtete die Besatzung des italienischen Schleppers „Asso 21“, der ebenfalls am Sonntag 250 Flüchtlinge an Bord genommen hatte und dann unter Hilfestellung eines am Frontex-Einsatz beteiligten isländischen Schiffs den Kahn auf den Haken nehmen sollte. Dieser Plan wurde von Männern auf einem Boot der libyschen Küstenwache – die aber offenbar Schleuser waren – durchkreuzt: Sie feuerten in Richtung des italienischen Schiffs und vereitelten so die Abschleppaktion.Der Vorfall ist der zweite dieser Art seit Jahresbeginn; der italienischen Küstenwache gilt er als Indiz, dass in Libyen die Boote knapp werden und deshalb auch jene schrottreifen Kähne, die bisher in der Regel bloß zur einmaligen Überfahrt bestimmt waren, zum kostbaren Gut werden.Rassistischer Wahlkampf in ItalienDramatische Berichte gab es auch von anderen Flüchtlingsschiffen. So sagten die Insassen eines Schlauchboots nach ihrer Rettung aus, ein Passagier sei während der Überfahrt gestorben und daraufhin ins Wasser geworfen worden, wo er unter ihren Augen von Haien zerfleischt worden sei.Angesichts der vielen Neuankünfte von Flüchtlingen alarmierte das italienische Innenministerium die Präfekturen im ganzen Land; sie sollen schnellstens neue Notunterkünfte ausfindig machen. Doch die rechtspopulistisch-fremdenfeindliche Lega Nord ist offenbar entschlossen, die Flüchtlingsfrage zum zentralen Thema im beginnenden Wahlkampf für die Regionalwahlen Ende Mai zu machen.Lega-Nord-Chef Matteo Salvini erklärte, „wir sind bereit, jedwedes Hotel, jede Schule oder Kaserne zu besetzen, die für die angeblichen Flüchtlinge bestimmt sind“. Und der aus den Reihen der Lega stammende Präsident der Region Venetien Luca Zaia droht, die Aufnahme weiterer Flüchtlinge zu verweigern: „Ich lese, dass Venetien weitere 700 Plätze bereit stellen soll“, ließ er verlauten, „und ich antworte, dass die Zahl der verfügbaren Plätze null ist“.",32.996428,13.819375,Mediterranean Sea,,taz,http://www.taz.de/!5012573/,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,3240,Klara,06/06/2017,New Entry,17/06/2015,Till

The prayer for the dead took place after the Friday night worship.  Oumar Dansokho’s closed casket was then placed in the hall of the mosque to allow family and friends to say good-bye. The body was then taken to Brussels Cargo and  will be sent to Guinea on Tuesday.Oumar Dansokho died from his burns last Friday at the Neder-over-Heembeek military hospital. He had gone to Fedasil to request medical assistance. He regularly took part in the protests organised by the Ebola group, an association of migrants from African countries hit by the virus. He asked for asylum in 2008. “This young man went through several procedures and really struggled: sleeping rough under bridges, etc.” notes John’s Mbulula, coordinator for Asylum and Migration at Mrax (Movement Against Racism, Anti-Semitism and Xenophobia). “He was a young man who hoped for a better life. There are many such desperate cases.

Gemeinsam mit ihrem Mann und ihren vier Kindern war sie vor dem Krieg geflohen. Im März wagten sie schließlich von Libyen aus die Überfahrt nach Europa. Doch auf halben Weg zur italienischen Insel Lampedusa versagte der Motor des Bootes. Als ein Frachtschiff zur Hilfe nahte, kam es zu einer Tragödie, wie sie sich bei derartigen Vorfällen immer wieder ereignet: In Panik drängten alle Flüchtlinge auf eine Seite des Bootes, um sich an Bord des Frachters zu ziehen.

10/09/2014,10/09/14,487,N.N.,Palestine/Syria/Egypt/Sudan,drowned in the Mediterranean Sea after traffickers sank boat carrying 500 migrants,"The survivors told IOM Tuesday that they already had been forced to change boats three times. When they refused a fourth switch – because they felt the smaller vessel was unsafe – an violent argument ensued. The smugglers threatened that if the passengers did not board the smaller boat they would be returned to Egypt, the survivors told IOM. The migrants persisted saying they would rather return than board the smaller boat.At this stage, according to testimony from four of six survivors, the ten smugglers, said to be Palestinian and Egyptian, began yelling and throwing sticks at the migrants.The smuggler’s vessel approached the boat with migrants some of whom managed to jump into the smaller boat. Witnesses say the smugglers forced them in the water and then rammed the bigger boat. It began to sink immediately while the smugglers stayed in the area until they were certain that the migrant’s vessel had sunk, witnesses said.“After they hit our boat they waited to make sure that it had sunk completely before leaving. They were laughing” one of the survivors told IOM.“When the boat was first struck, one of the passengers killed himself in despair by hanging,” he added.The survivors, women among them, included two Palestinian nationals, an Egyptian national and one Syrian. All the witnesses stated that the smugglers were Palestinian and Egyptian nationals.The two Palestinian survivors in Crete said their voyage began hopefully at what they called a “travel” office in Gaza, which made arrangements to get them to Italy. The cost of travel for each migrant was US$2000, paid in advance. The survivors said they had received grants to rebuild their homes and used that to pay the smugglers. The migrants were advised by the “travel” office to be in a particular spot in Egypt so that they could travel onwards by boat.According to their statements, they arrived separately at the rendezvous in Egypt where four buses waited to take them to the Port of Damietta near Alexandria. The survivors estimated that each bus contained up to 100 persons. At the port they boarded a ship, which they estimated was 15-18 metres long with migrants already aboard.“When we got to the port to board it looked like the ship was already half full,” the witness said.The Captain did a headcount, and without including minors under 10 years old, counted 400-450 migrants. Based on this testimony IOM believes that up to 100 children may have been aboard and are lost at sea.According to witnesses testimony the ship had two decks with 300 people below and 200 on the upper deck. They were at sea for four days and had to change to smaller vessels three times. Witnesses stated that the 300 people who were in the lower deck were trapped and drowned immediately. The survivors say they watched as those thrown in the water clung to each other trying to stay alive.“The rest of us linked arms in a circle so that no one else would be lost,” a survivor told IOM in Crete.Several managed to stay above the water for up to three days. But on the third day the weather changed: strong winds and waves swept the area and people began to disappear under the water.Sometime later a freighter picked up nine survivors. Seven of these, including a 2 year-old girl were flown by a Greek military helicopter to hospital in Crete. One of the survivors perished and a girl remains in critical condition.Survivors in Crete have provided the authorities’ information on the criminal gangs to the Greek Coastguard.",36.115199,18.110768,Mediterranean (Malta),Malta,Reuters/GuardianUN/MPG/IOM/BBC/Telegraph/SP/Imkander,http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/09/smugglers-sink-migrant-boat-syrian-survivor.html#,487,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,487,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,487,,,,,,,,,,,487,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,487,,,,,,487,,,,,,,,,,,,,3169,Dorien,07-05-2018,New Entry,12/09/2014,Dorien

30/08/2014,30/08/14,1,N.N. (man),Cameroon,died while trying to climb a fence separating Morocco from the Spanish enclave of Melilla,"Dos subsaharianos resultaron muertos durante el último asalto de la valla de Melilla, el 30 de agosto, según el diputado Jon Iñarritu (Amaiur) y ONG de apoyo a los inmigrantes que trabajan en la provincia fronteriza marroquí de Nador. Iñarritu estaba ese día en Melilla.Los dos jóvenes cameruneses murieron en territorio marroquí donde el asalto fue reprimido por las Fuerzas Auxiliares (antidisturbios). El cuerpo sin vida de uno de ellos, Roumian Tissé de 26 años, fue visto horas después en el depósito de cadáveres del hospital Hassani de Nador por voluntarios de una ONG.Estas personas escucharon después el testimonio de otro camerunés que fue tratado de sus heridas en Hassani. Aseguró que había visto el cuerpo sin vida de un hermano suyo que intentó saltar la valla, arrastrado por los antidisturbios marroquíes. Otros subsaharianos avalaron este relato, pero el difunto no fue llevado al depósito de cadáveres del hospital. Los dos jóvenes son los primeros fallecidos a las puertas de Melilla desde noviembre de 2013.Las autoridades marroquíes no han informado de que durante el salto de ese día hubiese muertos aunque sus interlocutores españoles en Melilla si conocen lo ocurrido. Sobre las cinco de la madrugada unos 250 subsaharianos intentaron, el sábado pasado, cruzar a la carrera la frontera internacional de Beni Enzar. La policía española reaccionó con rapidez y cerró la verja impidiendo su entrada. La frontera quedó clausurada un buen rato.El mismo grupo se dirigió entonces hacia la zona llamada Arroyo de Beni Enzar y trató de saltar la valla. Solo 15 lo consiguieron mientras que unos 70 lograron encaramarse a la verja y otros 160 fueron parados antes de alcanzarla por las Fuerzas Auxliares. Ambos cameruneses estarían en este último grupo.Los primeros inmigrantes muertos este año fueron, en febrero, 15 subsaharianos que intentaban llegar a nado a Ceuta y sobre los que la Guardia Civil disparó pelotas de goma. Hasta entonces y desde 2005, el año de los primeros asaltos masivos, fallecieron 20 subsaharianos -14 en Melilla y 6 en Ceuta- tratando de franquear la valla. Ese año el Ministerio del Interior marroquí reconoció la muerte de algunos subsaharianos, pero sobre los fallecidos del pasado fin de semana guarda silencio.El diputado Iñarritu se quejó de que las fuerzas de seguridad españolas le impidieron, el 30 de agosto, acercarse a la valla. Trataba de escuchar con más nitidez lo que gritaban algunos de los subsaharianos subidos en lo alto. ""Explicaban que a los que estaban abajo los marroquíes les pegaban con dureza"", declaró Iñarritu.Dos periodistas de TV3 fueron multados, a principios de agosto, con 150 euros cada uno por filmar cerca de la valla durante un asalto. La Asociación de la Prensa de Melilla protestó, el 25 de agosto, por las crecientes trabas que las fuerzas de seguridad ponen a los periodistas en el ejercicio de su labor. La Delegación del Gobierno de Melilla respondió en un comunicado que no se les sancionó por querer grabar imágenes sino ""por desobediencias a agente de la autoridad"". La Guardia Civil les ordenó que se alejaran de la valla impidiéndoles, en la práctica, tomar imágenes.Estas restricciones en el acceso a la verja se aplican, según afirma Iñarritu, a petición de Marruecos. Rabat no permite que la prensa y las ONG se acerquen a la valla desde el territorio marroquí y desearía que las autoridades españolas hicieran otro tanto, según contaron al diputado agentes con los que habló.El Ministerio del Interior marroquí hace especial hincapié en ello desde que hace un mes un juez instructor de Melilla ordenó la identificación, a través de comisión rogatoria, de los militares y gendarmes de Marruecos que aparecen en un vídeo rodado en la frontera. En las imágenes se ve como agreden a inmigrantes.--Dass Flüchtlinge bei solchen Abwehr-Einsätzen getötet werden, ist kein Einzelfall: Am 30. August starben der 26-jährige Roumian Tisse und ein weiterer Mann, beide aus Kamerun, auf marokkanischem Territorium bei dem Versuch, über den Zaun zu klettern.

When they tugged on the wet cloth, they discovered it was attached to a boy in the compartment, officials said.The Pentagon's press secretary, Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby, said the stowaway was a black male who may have been of African origin. The plane was on a routine mission in Africa and had made stops in Senegal, Mali, Chad, Tunisia and Naval Air Station Sigonella in Sicily before arriving at Ramstein.It is considered unlikely the child got on in Sigonella because that air base is secure.A stowaway aboard a military plane is a significant security breach. No Africa Command senior leaders were on the flight.""Security is going to be looked at here. Obviously it would be,"" Kirby said. ""We try to provide as much security as we can for our aircraft when they're operating in remote locations, and this will all be part of the investigation.""He added, however, that some of the airfields where the planes land are very remote and the security isn't always up to the standards that are followed in the U.S. and other nations.Kirby had no details about how well-guarded the plane was during the Africa stops and said it was unclear how the boy managed to get into the compartment.""We'll learn what happened here and if there's corrective action that needs to be taken, we'll take it,"" he said.The body was not detected in routine pre-flight and post-flight checks during the trip, but was found during a more detailed maintenance inspection of the cargo plane, said Kirby.

The grim tally brings to some 800 the total number of deaths at sea so far this year, compared to a total of 600 deaths in all of 2013, and 500 in 2012.“The death of 260 people in less than ten days, in the most horrifying of circumstances, is evidence that the Mediterranean crisis is intensifying,” said António Guterres, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. “Europeans need to take urgent action to stop this catastrophe getting worse in the second half of 2014.”The tragedies mark an intensifying crisis on Europe’s shores, as many fleeing Eritrea, Syria and other countries torn by violence seek safety in Europe by risking their lives at sea in the hand of smugglers.More than 75,000 refugees and migrants arrived in Italy, Greece, Spain and Malta by sea in the first half of 2014 - 25 per cent more than the 60,000 who made the same journey in the whole of 2013, and over three times the 22,500 who arrived in all of 2012.Italy received the greatest number of arrivals (63,884), followed by Greece (10,080), Spain (1,000) and Malta (227). A further 21,000 refugees and migrants have arrived in Italy since 1 July. The largest numbers came from Eritrea, Syria and Mali. Most left from North Africa, and principally Libya.Huge numbers of these - nearly 11,000 — are children, and some 6,500 of those, mostly Eritreans, were on their own or separated from their families.Over the weekend of 19-20 July alone, Italian and Maltese authorities, together with several commercial vessels, rescued 8,000 people.Guterres praised both Italy and Malta for their efforts, but said European states needed to step up their assistance. He called on governments to strengthen rescue operations, provide swift access to asylum procedures for those in need of protection, and offer legal alternatives to dangerous sea crossings.Rescued refugees and migrants have reported handing over their life savings to smugglers, in order to travel in unseaworthy and overcrowded dinghies, packed into a few metres of space without food, water or life jackets.The journey can take between one and four days, depending on the weather, sea and boat conditions.

Since then, however, the inflow coming especially from Libyan coasts has not receded and the government appealed for more EU help in terms of funds and common strategy.The massive inflow tries to reach Italy as one of the easiest gateway to Europe, the Italian government pointed out, and as such should be addressed as a common problem. Yet, Italy seemed quite unsatisfied with the EU response so far and Interior Ministry Angelino Alfano restated the appeal in sharper tones on Saturday.""Mare Nostrum is not just an Italian operation. Either the EU takes responsibility or we will leave it and continue to help migrants alone. Yet, we cannot take charge of a disaster other Western countries have created in Libya,"" Alfano said.More than 2,500 people were rescued by the navy last week, and the Interior Minister recently stated almost 40,000 migrants reached Italy's coasts between January and May 2014.

According to this investigative account, the young Eritrean was seriously injured by a blow to the head from a stick used by one of the organizers of the journey, who is said to have beaten all the migrants to force them to board the raft quickly. The injury was made worse by the involuntary blows received from other migrants, who trampled him underfoot in the rush. The Eritrean was reportedly helped by others from his own country but to no avail. They did not throw the body overboard as they wanted to give him a proper burial. The police say that the two human smugglers were complicit - even if involuntarily so - in the man's death.

Er wurde 43 Jahre als. Mindestens zwölf Jahre hat er in Heiligenhaus im Flüchtlingslager gelebt. Heute haben seine Freunde und Freundinnen, die Heiligenhauser Flüchtlinge, beschlossen, eine Demonstration in Gedenken an Hassan und für das Recht auf würdiges Wohnen zu machen.Diese Demonstration soll am nächsten Donnerstag, dem 12.12. Uhr stattfinden. Auftakt der Demo ist um 16.00 an der Schule an der Ludgerusstraße, die zur Zeit als Flüchtlingslager genutzt wird. Die Flüchtlinge wollen von dort zum Heiligenhauser Sozialamt ziehen.Sie fordern:    Aufklärung, warum Hassan gestorben ist und warum so lange keine Hilfe kam.    Außerdem: Schließung des Flüchtlingslagers in der Schule und private Wohnungen für alle Familien und alleinstehenden Menschen, die in der Schule leben müssen.Hintergrund:Die Flüchtlinge aus Heiligenhaus berichten, Hassan ging es in der letzten Woche vor seinem Tod sehr schlecht und er verlor immer mehr Gewicht. Am Sonntag Mittag brach er schließlich zusammen und konnte sich nicht mehr bewegen.Sein Freund und Mitbewohner aus der Flüchtlingsunterkunft versuchte vergeblich, telefonisch Hilfe zu holen und einen Krankenwagen zu rufen. Um 13:16 rief er die Notrufnummer 112 an. Dort habe man ihn gefragt, was für eine Krankheit der Patient denn habe. Der Freund antwortete, er wisse es nicht, weil er ja kein Arzt sei, aber es wäre sehr schlimm und der Mensch könnte sterben. Daraufhin habe man ihm nur geantwortet, er solle erst einmal einen Arzt anrufen.Der Freund rief dann eine Viertelstunde nach dem ersten Notruf beim Polizeinotruf an. Dort wurde ihm gesagt, man sei nicht zuständig; es sei nicht das Problem der Polizei, wenn jemand krank sei.Zwei Stunden lang, so berichten die Flüchtlinge, kam kein Krankenwagen.Ein anderer Freund informierte schließlich telefonisch einen Notarzt. Der Arzt rief sofort, als er Hasan sah, den Krankenwagen an. Der Krankenwagen kam dann auch, allerdings erst zwei Stunden oder noch später nach dem ersten Notruf. Die Flüchtlinge berichten, dass Hassan erst zwischen 15:30 und 16 Uhr ins Krankenhaus Niederberg auf die Intensivstation gebracht worden sei.Am nächsten Tag wurde dem Freund dort mitgeteilt, dass Hassan gestorben sei. Der Arzt habe gemeint, dass Hassan wahrscheinlich noch leben würde, wenn er Stunden früher behandelt worden wäre.Auch die Heiligenhauser Flüchtlinge erfuhren am darauf folgenden Montag erst durch die Polizei von Hassans Tod. Alle waren voller Trauer, weil alle Hassan sehr gerne hatten. Viele haben ihn „Papa Hassan“ genannt. Viele hatten – und haben - auch Angst, weil nicht klar war, ob Hassan an einer ansteckenden Krankheit gestorben ist. Die Polizei teilte ihnen mit, dass am nächsten Morgen jemand von der Stadt kommen und ihnen die Todesumstände erklären würde.Am nächsten Morgen kam aber niemand. Daraufhin wurde eine spontane Flüchtlingsdemonstration zum Heiligenhauser Rathaus organisiert. Schließlich konnten sie im Ratssaal mit dem Kämmerer der Stadt sprechen; fünf Polizisten waren ebenfalls anwesend. Der Kämmerer konnte ihnen aber weder Informationen über die Todesumstände von Hassan geben, noch konnte er irgend etwas Substanzielles zu den Beschwerden der BewohnerInnen sagen. Die Flüchtlinge berichteten über ihre Lebensbedingungen in der Schule, darüber dass sie nur eine Dusche und viel zu wenig Toiletten für alle etwa achtzig BewohnerInnen haben, dass sie mit bis zu zehn Personen ein Zimmer teilen, dass es oft kein warmes Wasser gibt und die Heizung nicht richtig funktioniert. Die Wohnbedingungen machen sie krank.Wir wollen wissen, warum Hassan sterben musste. Und wir wollen um jeden Preis verhindern, dass noch jemand krank wird oder sterben muss – weil er unter gesundheitsgefährdenden Bedingungen wohnen muss, weil er nicht rechtzeitig behandelt wird, oder weil diejenigen, die helfen könnten, einfach nur gleichgültig und desinteressiert sind. In Heiligenhaus muss sich vieles ändern.

The one that might have changed the turn of events. It is the Coordination Centre of Rome belonging to the General Command of Harbour Master Authorities, a Navy sector within the Ministry of Transports upon which Coast Guard activities depend.  The ship loaded with Syrian refugees sinks 113 kilometres away from Lampedusa and 218 from kilometres from Malta. Cause of the disaster: the excessive number of passengers obliged to get on board by two brothers named Khaled and Mohamed (ruthless traffickers from the Zuwara port in Libya), in addition to rounds of machine-gun fire that were shot the previous night from a Libyan patrol boat and ended up piercing through the hull. Cause of the delay in rescue operations: passing the buck of responsibilities between Italy and Malta during research and rescue procedures has already caused dead and missing persons in the past.  The chronological reconstruction of events for this article was made possible by analyzing data from nearly thirteen-thousand positions of ships in transit: their coordinates, speed and direction, from eleven o’clock in the morning until midnight on Friday. A laboratory in Great Britain has extracted the emergency numbers memorized in one of the telephones that were fished out of the sea.  In addition to geographical and scientific data, there’s the eye-witness report provided by Admiral Felicio Angrisano (Commanding General of the Harbour Authorities Corps and of the Coast Guard) and the reports given by some Italian Navy officers.The point of no return of the tragedy is overcome at 1:00 p.m. on October 11th: at that time the Italian Operations Centre could have still saved the children and the other passengers. But it turns down direct intervention and passes the call for rescue on to its colleagues in Malta. Despite the fact that the distance between the boat full of children and Malta is double the distance between the boat and Lampedusa.  A decision which Admiral Angrisano explains in a written report forwarded to “l’Espresso” as follows: «The sequence of events described is in accordance with criteria of international conduct specifically outlined in the Hamburg Rules, appointing each State with the responsibility of coordinating research and rescue operations in defined and declared areas». Therefore they are telling the surviving mothers and fathers who have lost the rest of their family that their children, their loved ones have perished at sea in compliance to the Hamburg Rules, namely the agreement that since 1979 has entrusted the Ministry of Transports with the responsibility of rescue at sea.The Commanding General of the Italian Coast Guard confirms the testimony provided by Mohanad Jammo (40) and published by “l’Espresso” at the beginning of November. Their versions do not match only in one point.  Dr. Jammo, head physician working in the Intensive Care Unit of a hospital in Aleppo (Syria), has lost his six-year-old and nine-month-old children during the shipwreck. He’s the one who speaks with the Rescue Coordination Centre in Rome using a telephone on board the fishing-boat.  He calls upon the request of the “scafista” (people trafficker), who lends Dr. Jammo his Thuraya mobile satellite service.  Jammo calls Italy simply because the screens of three different GPS instruments on board report that Lampedusa is just a little over one-hundred kilometres away.  And that Malta is more than two-hundred kilometres away. A sense of logic and common sense would have urged anyone into making that choice. One-hundred kilometres means two hours of navigation for Coast Guard patrol boats and slightly more than an hour and a half for the fast patrol boats belonging to the Guardia di Finanza Corps stationed in Lampedusa that October 11th, following the shipwreck of Eritrean refugees that took place eight days earlier. «I called the same Italian telephone number three times», says Mohanad Jammo: «at about eleven o’clock in the morning, then at 12:30 p.m. and slightly before one o’clock in the afternoon». Jammo’s words are confirmed by another two surviving physicians:  Ayman Mustafa (38), surgeon, the father of Joud who is now officially lost at sea along with his mother Fatena (27); and by Mazen Dahhan (36), neurosurgeon, who lost his wife Reem (30) and their three children.The only thing that Admiral Angrisano denies is the eleven o’clock telephone call. All of the rest is confirmed.  «At 12:26 p.m.», he says, «a very disturbed telephone call reaches the Operations Centre from a satellite telephone, to the point of being unintelligible at times. After five minutes of attempts to communicate, the telephone line is cut off. According to my experience, I am however led into getting in touch with the Thuraya network provider whose premises are in the United Arab Emirates, as I have already done hundreds of times for similar cases».Eight minutes following the end of the first conversation, Dr. Jammo calls again.  It’s 12:39 p.m. and the telephone call continues until 12:56. The voice is more intelligible: «So much so as to allow us to acquire some elements, number and nationality of the people on board, place of departure, the presence of two children in need of treatment, and finally the position of the vessel whose engine had broken down and was shipping water», adds Angrisano.So the Operations Centre in Rome knows that there are refugees on board, that there are children, wounded and that the fishing-boat is sinking. Even ignoring the eleven o’clock telephone call, that is in any case confirmed by Mohanad Jammo, at one o’clock they still have enough time on their hands to dispatch some patrol boats from Lampedusa. And, calculating their speed, they could reach destination between 2:30 and 3:00 p.m.   Namely at least two hours before the slaughter takes place. Then there’s the Libra and further away, at a distance of 96 kilometres, the Espero. These two military ships are in the area to protect Italian fishing-boats from Libyan attacks. In other words, Maltese patrol boats would have to travel double the distance compared to the two patrol boats belonging to the Italian Navy. And compared to the vessels still in Lampedusa, which are mostly anchored in the port that afternoon. Yet the Operations Centre in Rome passes the call for rescue on to Malta at one o’clock.When the Italian Coast Guard announces its decisions to Mohanad Jammo, he begs them: «Please, we’re about to die». And the military tells him over the telephone: «Please call Maltese authorities. I’ll give you the number:  it’s 00356...».«If you listen to the recording», recalls Dr. Jammo, «you’ll see that he didn’t even give me enough time.  He hung up before I finished writing the number down». This invitation to directly get in touch with Malta, explains Admiral Angrisano, «is in compliance with a clear, tested and productive method that through direct contact between those who ask for help and those who are obliged to provide assistance produces more effective and productive rescue operations».  Everyone on board is terrified. The lower deck is completely flooded.  Passengers begin to climb up to the main deck and then up onto the top deck. Mazen Dahhan, who’s down there, gets hold of his children Mohamed (9), Tarek (4) and little Bisher (1) and then passes them up to Ayman Mustafa who gets them to sit on the dry floor. Little Joud is still asleep, hugging onto her mother.Even Jammo’s eldest son Mohamad (6) is sleeping in the sunshine.  He opens his eyes for an instant and watches his father standing on the roof of the control cabin, whose voice gets more and more desperate as he continues to call Malta over a satellite phone. Their eyes meet for a fleeting moment.  His father gives Mohamad the thumbs-up. The little boy smiles at him and then goes back to sleep.  That is the last time they gazed upon each other.«The vessel is in waters belonging to Malta’s jurisdiction», insists Admiral Felicio Angrisano in his written report. «That Coordination Centre is therefore summoned at one o’clock by the Coast Guard Operations Centre, informing them that it has also identified two merchant ships in the area, closer to the migrants’ boat, respectively at a distance of 25 and 70 miles». At 1:05 p.m. Maltese authorities, according to the Commander of the Coast Guard, take over the management of rescue and emergency operations. Again according to Admiral Angrisano: «In the meantime, according to provisions of the Chief Command of the Navy squadron, even the Libra with helicopter on board heads in that direction». But there’s something that doesn’t add up.According to the Italian Navy, at 1:34 p.m. the Libra is only 27 miles away from spot the call of rescue was made from. That’s equal to 50 kilometres. At the ship’s top speed of 20 knots (37 kilometres per hour) considering the calm seas, Libra could have reached the refugees in an hour and a half. Namely already at three o’clock in the afternoon. But on the contrary, it only gets there at six o’clock: because only after the children’s boat sinks do Maltese coordinators ask the Operations Centre in Rome for Italian assistance. At 5:14 p.m, when it finally receives orders to intervene, the Libra ship is still ten miles (18 kilometres) away. In other words, it’s been sailing for hours while awaiting for someone to decide what must be done. Four and a half hours to travel 50 kilometres means an average speed of 11 kilometres per hour, less than 6 knots: certainly not at an emergency pace. There’s another incredible story behind 1:34 p.m. that afternoon. It’s the moment in which the notice to mariners by the Operations Centre in Rome is broadcast all over the world:  the “hydrolant 2545” warning asks all ships in transit to help out the fishing-boat if possible, as discovered by Charles Heller, researcher at Goldsmiths college, University of London, and one of the founders of the watchthemed.net project. Ships in transit. And not the Libra. Why? «The Rome Coordination Centre immediately offers the contribution requested by indicating the presence, in the vaster area, of two merchant ships and a ship belonging to the Italian Navy», affirms Coast Guard command:  «The authorities who, according to the Hamburg Rules, assume the administration and coordination of rescue activities, decide upon the timing, methods and even eventual requests for cooperation». In other words, it’s the fault of those in Malta who forget to engage the Libra in rescue activities. Maltese Armed Forces still have to provide explanations.At 4:22 p.m., authorities in Malta inform Rome that one of their aircrafts has identified the fishing-boat adrift.  At 5:07 p.m., once again from Valletta, they transit a bulletin informing that the boat has capsized and ask Italy for help.The first rescue boat, namely the Maltese P61 patrol boat, reaches the site only at 5:51 p.m.  It is joined by Libra at around six o’clock .  In the meantime, patrol boats CP301 and CP301 are dispatched from Lampedusa, together with two fast patrol boats belonging to the Guardia di Finanza Corps.

(1 newborn, 4 chn, 94 w)",Eritrea/Somalia/Ghana,"drowned when boat from Libya caught fire and sank off Lampedusa (I), 155 rescued","On 3 October 2013, a 20-m boat carrying migrants from Libya to Italy sank off the Italian island of Lampedusa. It was reported that the boat had sailed from Misrata, Libya, but that many of the migrants were originally from Eritrea, Somalia and Ghana. An emergency response involving the Italian Coast Guard and fishermen resulted in the rescue of 155 survivors. On 12 October it was reported that the confirmed death toll after searching the boat was 359, but that further bodies were still missing; a figure of ""more than 360"" deaths was later reported.[5]It turned out later that the captain had decided to set fire to a blanket or T-shirt to attract the attention of coast guards or other boats after the boat had been a few hundred meters near the coast without assistance, not being able to get closer due to a broken motor (?). There are reports that several boats approached but then disappeared again. The fire got into contact with oil or gasoline that was on deck, causing everything to catch fire and people panicked. Some were burned, others trampled in the panic, others jumped overboard, and the chaos caused the boat to capsize. The boat was believed to have been carrying around 500 passengers, mostly from Eritrea and Somalia. 373 bodies were found, but one source puts the final death toll at 386.According to VK the 373 bodies found were all buried “in a hurry” in Sicily, out of fear for public health, without waiting for a state ceremony, although a state funeral had been announced. Families of the victims would prefer them to be buried at home, but that would be complicated for them to arrange.Of the ca. 100 women on board, only 6 survived. 2 of the female victims were pregnant, and the dead included at least 4 children (as can also be seen on pictures of the coffins, where all coffins were long and brown except 4 special child coffins which were smaller and white). One victim was giving birth as she drowned. She was 20 years old and 7 months pregnant, and the panic and terror of the incident probably triggered her premature delivery. When her body was found, the newborn boy was discovered inside her leggings, still attached to the umbilical cord. He was buried in the same coffin as his mother.According to several reports, the migrants on board had been tortured and all the women raped by the traffickers. Several people were arrested in connection to the shipwreck: the Tunisian captain, as well as a Palestinian and Somalian. Later the name of an important smuggling leader, Medhanie Yhdego Mered, was tracked down by the EU’s anti-smuggling “Operation Sophia”. Phone conversations connected to this shipwreck were found, between him and other smugglers. Italian police arrested him in the summer of 2015, an event which was all over the media. Unfortunately, according to the “Groene Amsterdammer” it turns out that they have arrested the wrong man, a former milk-seller and migrant called Medhanie Berhe. Mered’s wife, brother, migrants that he has smuggled, and many other people are convinced that the arrested man is not Mered, but Medhanie Berhe has still not been released at the time of writing (September 2017) despite proof of his innocence.",35.466798,12.612975,Lampedusa,Italy,VK/NRC/ANP/AiN/Presse/NYtimes/BBC/Guardian/DW/ECRE/GroeneAms/Xinhua/LocalIT/MailOnline/MNS,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Lampedusa_migrant_shipwreck,373,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,373,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,373,,,,,,,373,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,373,,,,,,373,,,,,,,,,,,,,2960,Dorien,26-04-2018,New Entry,23/01/2014,Babs

Indeed, after a few minutes they receive a call from a Greek cell, Kelani explains to the woman on the other side of the line the dire straits they’re in and they agree to light a small fire on the edge of the rock so that the lifeboat can spot them. Within two hours, the lifeboat arrives, the refugees light the small fire as agreed, the boat throws the spot light on them, they exchange signs of recognition, the refugees take the fire out and after a while the boat leaves, only to return twenty minutes later and repeat the whole procedure (without the need of a fire this time) -but then leaves again, and this time for good. Some time later the refugees receive a call from the same Greek cellphone and the same woman informs them that help has not been sent yet! Unfortunately, their cellphone battery soon runs out so they lose all possibility of communication.They spend the rest of the night there and, when the dawn of the 22nd breaks, with all water supplies long gone and Lamis’ situation worsening, they decide that Jihad will stay with the mother and the children, Mohammad will look for help further inland and the father will go the opposite way -back to the sea. Indeed, after a good swim, he reaches another shore, passes out on the rocks, wakes up, sees a fishing boat, signals to them only to be ignored, walks for about two hours, and makes it to a house where he asks for help. The people there call the police that soon arrive, Wasim desperately points to the direction where he’s left his family (“mybaby…”), they start heading that way, but soon the policemen tell him that a fire has broken out in the area and they take him to Samos police station.During that time, Mohammad, having found some water, returns to Jihad and the family and they all decide to try and go further inland. Some time later, Lamis finds it impossible to walk any further, the two men decide to go on and, two and a half hours later, they make it to a church where they find water and fall asleep exhausted. A while later, they are found by men of the Fire Brigade, whom they inform on the family’s situation and whereabouts, only to be taken to the police station.Wasim Abounahi, despite all his desperate appeals, stayed in custody for 15 days, most of which he spent tied on a chair, and then he was taken to the island’s Detention Center, where he stayed for another fortnight. When he arrived in Athens and the issue became more widely known (lawyers had already reported on the missing persons by the 13th of August and had filed a report to the Greek Ombudsman by the 14th), the police, under increasing pressure, stated they had searched extensively for the woman and the two kids, a claim that was tragically refuted by the fact that, in the afternoon of September 6, Wasim Abounahi, with the help of a nephew and a friend, discovered his family’s scorched remains.",37.743215,26.820351,Samos,Greece,MNS/ Infomob/ RoarMag,http://infomobile.w2eu.net/2013/09/10/chronicle-of-a-state-crime-the-death-of-a-syrian-mother-and-her-two-children-in-samos/,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,2986,Dorien,01-05-2018,New Entry,19/02/2014,Babs

(woman),unknown,died during childbirth on boat between Turkey and Italy; newborn survived,"REGGIO CALABRIA - A far capire come era andata sono stati i silenzi più che le parole. Gli occhi bassi dei migranti hanno raccontato ai loro soccorritori la tragedia nella tragedia. La neonata partorita durante il viaggio in mare tra la costa turca e quella di Roccella Jonica, nella Locride, sta bene. Ma della sua mamma non c'è traccia. Gli investigatori sono convinti che sia morta dandola alla luce, o immediatamente dopo. E che i suoi compagni di viaggio ne abbiano abbandonato il corpo al mare. La piccola si chiama Nojian - che significa ""nuova vita"" - le sue condizioni di salute sono confortanti. I medici dell'ospedale di Locri dicono che fisicamente è a posto: ""due chili di gioia. Reagisce bene la piccina"". Quando ieri sera il barcone di legno è stato avvistato a largo delle coste calabresi è immediatamente scattata la macchina dei soccorsi che lungo la costa jonica è ormai rodata. Le motovedette della Capitaneria di Porto hanno scortato la carretta che a malapena stava a galla al porto di Roccella. Qui è stata notata la piccola nata evidentemente da pochi giorni, era in grembo a una giovane donna con il ventre ancora rigonfio. Per questo i soccorritori hanno pensato che si trattasse della madre. Trasferite entrambe in ospedale per i controlli, al reparto di ginecologia la donna è risultata però incinta. Non era lei la madre, nè lo era una tra le altre quattordici donne sbarcate nel corso della notte. Secondo la prima ricostruzione degli investigatori, durante il viaggio durato  6 o 7 giorni, la bambina è stata data alla luce sull'imbarcazione da un'altra donna. La madre sarebbe morta durante il parto e nelle ore successive. Sarebbero stati gli altri compagni di viaggio ad affidare il suo corpo a Mediterraneo non potendo fare altro. Al momento, nonostante i silenzi dei 161 clandestini non c'è altra spiegazione.A bordo del vecchio barcone malandato i migranti erano stipati in non più di 20 metri, in condizioni disumane. Hanno viaggiato per giorni protetti, durante il giorno e la notte, soltanto da un grande telone di plastica nera. Una tettoia di fortuna sotto la quale è nata la piccola. Il gruppo era in gran parte formato da uomini adulti, insieme a loro 15 donne e 20 minori di diverse nazionalità. All'anagrafe dei soccorritori hanno detto di essere siriani, afghani, egiziani e pachistani. Alcuni di loro hanno intrapreso un lungo viaggio attraversando diversi paesi per raggiungere la costa turca, da qui l'ultimo tratto per superare il Mediterraneo. Ad alcuni chilometri dalla costa l'imbarcazione è stata intercettata dai mezzi della Capitaneria che l'hanno agganciata e portata fino al porto. Qui forze dell'ordine e volontari hanno lavorato tutta la notte per soccorrere i migranti maggiormente provati dai giorni trascorsi in mare senza cibo e con pochissima acqua. Per quattro di loro è stato necessario il ricovero in ospedale, ma anche le loro condizioni non sono preoccupanti.

As his application was turned down and he had exhausted all channels of appeal, he left Norway in 2011.On 18 May 2013, he was reported missing by his family, and on 10 June 2013, his decomposing body with numerous signs of torture was found in a river in Kali municipality in Chechnya.According to the autopsy report seen by Ny Tid, his teeth and fingernails had been pulled out, his skull had been broken, as well as his kneecap, and there were deep puncture wounds on his body.The Norwegian Immigration Appeals Board have seen the autopsy report and have accepted its authenticity....Commenting on these two cases on behalf of the Norwegian Immigration authorities (UDI), Torgeir TOFTE JøRGENSEN of the Immigraton Appeals Board (UNE) defended the decisions to deny both men asylum in Norway.‘’We believe that the decisions made were correct. One was heard by three judicial bodies where everyone agreed with the UNE. One of them was sent to Moscow, and we thought that it was dangerous for him to travel to Chechnya. He travelled on his own to Chechnya.’’...Mr NAZJUJEV has a sister who lives in Sweden and she has firmly rejected the UNE’s claim that her brother had travelled voluntarily to Chechnya.According to her, after his arrival in Moscow, he was ordered to go to Chechnya or else his family there would be tortured and killed.The Russian authorities had told him that he would not be allowed to remain in Moscow and he had the choice of either going to Chechnya ‘’voluntarily’’ or by force.The sister also said that her brother chose voluntary repatriation to Moscow because the Norwegian authorities had informed him that he would get no financial assistance if they expelled him by force.",42.692403,45.530391,"Kali, Chechnya",Russia,Ny Tid,https://www.nytid.no/torturert-og-drept-etter-a-ha-blitt-nektet-asyl-i-norgae/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,3330,Klara,22/06/2017,New Entry,15/02/2017,Klara

It was unnecessary. He was a frail person. He could barely walk. He was ... unwell.”Jurors heard earlier how Dvorzac had arrived in the UK three weeks earlier from Canada and was travelling to Slovenia to be reunited with his daughter. He had “escaped” from a hospital in Canada where he had been sent from the care home. He was on heavy medication including drugs for dementia and blood thinners for a heart condition.Vernon Simmonds-Dunne, a detention custody officer at Harmondsworth responsible for elderly detainees, told jurors Dvorzac did not understand why he was in detention. “All he kept saying was he wanted to see his family. There was one other question [which] was: ‘When can I go?’” Simmonds-Dunne said.The day Dvorzac was rushed to hospital, his blood sugars were high and his pulse was irregular, jurors heard. He was taken from his bed in Harmondsworth in a wheelchair, placed on the bed in the ambulance and secured by strapping to his chest. He was handcuffed on one wrist with a six-ft-long chain securing him to an escort officer sitting beside him.“I questioned why he was being handcuffed,” said Ambrosino, referring to a man in a white shirt who appeared to be in charge of the emergency escort. “He told me it was Home Office procedures. I felt it was unnecessary. He was an elderly person, he wasn’t going to run away.”Ambrosino said the patient appeared upset and was uncooperative when he tried to conduct a chest examination. He pulled off one of the plastic stickers used for the electrodes and threw it on the floor and then turned to the side of the ambulance and went quiet.The senior coroner, Chinyere Inyama, asked Ambrosino if he had been told that the handcuffing procedures were in place because of previous escapes. He replied: “No, I was just told it was Home Office procedure.”Earlier, the jury heard that Dvorzac had suffered two heart attacks and was on 13 medications. After spending his first night in Gatwick airport, he was taken to a hospital for assessment and was deemed fit to be returned to Canada. Plans were in place for a deportation but he died in hospital. His relatives were told months later.On Monday, one of the two officers who escorted him to hospital told the court it was routine for detainees to be handcuffed. Dvorzac’s handcuffs were taken off only “when they realised he had stopped breathing”, said Katerina Tanasan, one of the custody officers working for the private firm Geo.On Tuesday, Emma Donoghue, head of primary care at Heathrow’s immigration removal centre, said a system was set up 12 months ago to deal with detainees who showed “vulnerabilities outside the norm”.The weekly meeting of Home Office staff, site operators, and health workers would deal with “rare” cases like that of Dvorzac she said. It would try and find a secure hospital place for a detainee like him and try and locate relatives.Simmonds-Dunne said he told Dvorzac about plans to deport him to Canada and not on to Slovenia. “The emotion went down a bit. He looked a bit tearful. What he actually said was: ‘I don’t have much time. I need to see my family,” he said.Asked by one juror if he had the impression Dvorzac wanted to go home to die, Simmonds-Dunne replied: “Every time I saw him, he was out of bed and smartly dressed as if he was ready to walk out and continue his journey.”The inquest continues.",51.487453,-0.475554,Harmondsworth,GB,Independent/GuardianUN./BBC/MNS/MailOnline,www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/oct/27/man-84-awaiting-deportation-died-in-handcuffs-home-office-inquest,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,3217,Banu,23/02/2018,New Entry,09/01/2015,Anastasia

As a result of the clash, seven migrants were lost at sea and one was found dead. The Guardia Civil managed to rescue seventeen other migrants. According to Guardia Civil, a broken turbine on their patrol boat resulted in the boat crashing against the migrants’ boat. According to the survivors’ declaration in the local court of Arrecife (Lanzarote) the patrol boat approached them at high speed and without lights, so they could only hear its engine. This contradicts the Guardia Civil’s claim that they acted in compliance with protocol and that the patrol lights were on when approaching the migrants’ boat. Source: EL Pais, 17 December 2012 and EL Pais,18 December, 2012",28.869017,-13.425178,Lanzarote,Spain,PICUM/ ElPais/ FFM/ Taz,http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2012/12/18/actualidad/1355866141_670808.html,8,,,,,,,,,,,,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8,,,,,,,,,,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8,,,,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,2947,Dorien,01-05-2018,New Entry,22/01/2014,Babs

Han hadde fått endelig avslag på asylsøknaden sin.– Jeg kjenner mange som har fått endelig avslag og som blir sittende på asylmottak. Ventetida blir lang og tung, og det tar på psykisk, sier Armando til NRK.no.Fredag i forrige uke tok 20 år gamle Newzad fra Irak sitt eget liv ute i skogen like ved Rognan Mottakssenter i nordlandskommunen Saltdal.Han var en av over 40 beboere ved mottaket med endelig avslag på asylsøknaden og ei svært usikker framtid.Dødsfallet har gått sterkt inn på både ansatte og beboerne på mottaket.– Det preger oss alle sammen. Det er veldig trist. Våre tanker går til Newzads familie og de beboerne som har hatt mest kontakt med ham, sier mottaksleder Anita Paulsen ved asylmottaket på Rognan til NRK.no.18 dødsfall så langt i årNewzad ble den 18 asylsøkeren som har mistet livet på norske mottak i år. Men ingen vet hvor mange av dem som har tatt livet sitt. Noen mil unna i Bodø er det kurdiske miljøet frustrert over at hjelpen kom for sent.– Det var veldig trist det som skjedde. Han hadde slitt lenge med hodet, og prøvd flere ganger å ta livet sitt. Han ba flere ganger om hjelp, men ble ofte overlatt til seg selv, noe han ikke burde, sier kurderen Alex Armando, som kjente Newzad godt.Ifølge vennen var Newzad lagt inn på sykehus, men fikk lov å reise hjem til Rognan.– Mange klikkerArmando kjenner mange asylsøkere som blir sittende på mottak etter at de har fått avslag på asylsøknaden sin.– Mange kan klikke om de ikke får hjelp. Problemet er at man må vente for lenge slik det fungerer i dag. Saksbehandlingstiden bør ned så at man får raskere svar samtidig som de som får avslag må få hjelp til å sendes raskere ut, mener han.På Rognan ønsker ikke mottaksledelsen å kommentere dødsfallet nærmere – men for leder Anita Paulsen er bekymringen at stadig flere blir sittende lenge på mottak med endelig avslag.– De oppholder seg ulovlig i Norge. Derfor bør det skje noe når det gjelder ventetiden for uttransporteringen. Den går ikke raskt nok i dag, sier hun til NRK.no.NOAS bekymretOgså norsk organisasjon for asylsøkere (NOAS) er bekymret for den helsemessige oppfølging av asylsøkere som blir sittende på mottakene. – Det er opplagt at det er en belastning å vente så lenge. Mange av disse har rømt fra veldig vanskelige situasjoner. Noen av dem har traumatiske opplevelser. Det å bo tett oppå hverandre når du kommer fra helt forskjellige kulturer, i bygninger som definitivt ikke er bygd for dette formålet, kan fort skape spenninger. Det å ikke kunne jobbe eller utøve andre aktiviteter, blir en ekstra belastning for folk som sliter i utgangspunktet, sier generalsekretær Ann-Margrit Austenå i NOAS.I Bodø håper også vennene til Newzad at situasjon for asylsøkerne på mottak med psykiske problemer blir bedre, før det går galt igjen.– Jeg kjenner mange unge menn både i Bodø og i Saltdal som framstår som friske, men som fort kan klikke. UDI bør jobbe sammen for å finne gode løsninger for disse unge mennene. Det er ikke bare bra for dem, men også for den norske befolkningen, sier Alex Armando.Har seg selv å takke for lang ventetidNår asylsøkerne får avslag må de vente ofte mange år før de blir transportert ut av landet. Ifølge politiet har asylsøkerne seg selv å takk dersom de må sitte i mottakene å vente.– Når det siste negative vedtaket om avslaget er meddelt får de en utreisefrist på en måned. Da har man muligheten til å reise frivillig og motta en pengesum. Dersom det ikke skjer, er det politiets rolle å føre disse personene ut av landet, sier politioverbetjent Harald Jacobsen, som er sjef for Utlendingsenheten ved Salten politidistrikt.Utfordringen til politiet er at ikke kan være sikker på identiteten til disse menneskene.– Vi skal ha dem verifisert og akseptert av hjemlandet før de kan returneres, og det kan ofte ta svært lang tid dersom disse personene ikke samarbeider med politiet for å framskaffe identifikasjonspapirer. Da må vi gå andre veier og andre kanaler, og dette tar også tid, sier Jacobsen.At ventetiden kan bli lang og tung for dem som venter, er godt kjent hos politiet.– Den frustrasjonen kan jeg forstå. Men samtidig er det vanskelig for oss å forstå at de ikke da samarbeider med oss og framlegger sin virkelige identitet, sier Jacobsen.Politiet bruker i dag store ressurser både lokalt og sentralt i utlendingsenheten på å framskaffe identitetsdokumenter.I årets ni første måneder har det vært 18 dødsfall i norske asylmottak.Ifølge tall fra UDI har antallet beboere på norske mottak gått ned fra 20.000 i 2009 til 15.700 i 2011.

The migrants on board included Syrians, Iraqis, and others.  At least 49 survivors were able to swim ashore.

07/07/2012,07/07/12,1,"Noureddin Mohamed (28, man)",Sudan,found dead under suspicious circumstances in Calais (FR) city canal,"Our friend Noureddin Mohamed died in the centre of Calais in the early hours of Saturday morning (7 July 2012). Noureddin was 28 years old. Originally from North Darfur, Sudan, he had been in Calais for more than four years. He was well known and loved in Calais, and leaves many grieving friends. He died just some 200 metres from the Sub-prefecture (government office) where he had recently been granted leave to remain in France as a refugee.hat night, Noureddin had been out with a group of friends in the town centre. But a normal night out in Calais, if you are black or look “foreign”, means the constant danger of harassment and aggression from the police. In Calais companies of CRS riot police patrol the streets night and day with specific orders to stop anyone who looks like a migrant, and arrest anyone who can’t show the right travel documents. Despite a recent French appeal court ruling against such racist policing (see notes), nothing has changed.According to Noureddin’s friends, as they left a bar near the main street Rue Royale, they were once again stopped aggressively by the police. Refugees are used to this treatment in Calais, and generally shrug it off. Noureddin and his friends split up, and Noureddin left alone on his way home. Minutes later he was dead. At 3.30 am, his body was dragged out of the canal 200 metres from the Sub-Prefecture.Noureddin’s friends do not believe that his death was an accident. And they do not believe the official story, which was immediately parroted without further investigation by the local press. According to the police, Noureddin stole a mobile phone from a woman, her friends chased him, and Noureddin jumped into the canal where he drowned. Everyone who knew Noureddin insists that he was not a thief, and had never done anything like this. Nor do they believe that he simply “jumped”. The police have provided no evidence for their story, except the word of the three people who are supposed to have chased Noureddin.We cannot say, at this point, whether the police were involved in Noureddin’s death. We do not currently know the truth about the three people who are supposed to have chased him. We do know that racist attacks against migrants are all too common in Calais, sometimes involving local fascist groups, as well as the police themselves. Whatever happened that night, Noureddin’s death deserves a proper investigation.Instead, the case was closed immediately, and the police have refused to perform an autopsy. On Wednesday (11 July) Noureddin’s uncle submitted an official demand to the state prosecutor for an inquiry into “murder by persons unknown”. According to legal counsel, this demand means that the authorities should now perform an autopsy and reopen the investigation. So far, though, there has been no official response.",50.95129,1.858686,Calais,France,CMS/INDgb,http://calaismigrantsolidarity.wordpress.com/2012/07/12/justice-for-noureddin-mohamed/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,3078,Klara,21/06/2017,New Entry,17/06/2014,Babs

He was captured by DS officers, who took him to Paola polyclinic in the early hours of Saturday 30 June, and found to be dead on arrival, having sustained various injuries to his groin and lower back, presumably as a result of being severely beaten.Echoing the UNHCR and a number of NGOs, AD called for an immediate review of Malta's detention policy.Robert Callus, the Green Party's spokesperson for migration and citizenship, said: ""For 10 years the government tried to give the impression that migration is a temporary phenomenon when they knew pretty well it wasn't.""""The Government ignored detention problems, exploitation at the place of work and only paid lip service to integration policy. Addressing these serious problems would have exposed what they knew all along - that some migrants are here to stay,"" Callus said.1st July 2012Appalled and saddened by the tragic death of Mamadou Kamara in Detention Service (DS) custody on June 30, 2012 we the undersigned NGOs unequivocally condemn this act of violence and call upon the Government to take all the steps necessary to ensure that his death, not the first to occur in such circumstances, is the last.According to press reports, Mamadou attempted to escape from detention on Friday afternoon. He was captured by DS officers, who took him to Paola polyclinic in the early hours of Saturday June 30, in line with established standard operating procedures. He was found to be dead on arrival, having sustained various injuries to his groin and lower back, presumably as a result of being severely beaten.“We believe that these and other violent incidents that have occurred over the years demonstrate that Malta’s initial reception system has repeatedly failed and that the costs of the mandatory detention policy far outweigh the potential benefits for all concerned,” Dr. Katrine Camilleri, JRS Malta Director.We are also concerned that political discourse on the part of the Government and the main opposition has contributed to the dehumanization of asylum seekers. The consequences of this are nothing less than horrific.Malta’s human rights obligations demand that the individual officers involved in the incident are called to account for their actions, yet we believe that this alone is insufficient. “Malta is duty-bound to ensure that all persons deprived of their personal liberty – for whatever reasons – are effectively protected from torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Their right to life must be safeguarded and any alleged violations must be investigated and perpetrators brought to justice. Importantly, any institutional failures should be addressed in order to prevent future violations,” Dr. Neil Falzon, aditus foundation Director.We therefore call upon the Office of the Prime Minister to demonstrate its true commitment to ensure that all persons are treated with the equal respect and dignity by:Ensuring that the present inquiry is truly independent and effective, and that its findings, recommendations and any consequential actions are made public; Conducting a comprehensive and inclusive review of Malta’s policy of mandatory detention, including implementing non-custodial alternatives for asylum seekers and migrants in an irregular situation for whom there is little or no prospect of removal; Acting speedily and decisively to implement recommendations made following inquiries into such incidents; Strengthening the mandate and capacity of the Detention Visitors Board, the body established by law to monitor conditions in detention, to fulfil the onerous task with which it has been entrusted, not least by making its recommendations binding on the Commander of the Detention Service.Non-governmental Organisations:aditus foundation, Jesuit Refugee Service (Malta), SOS Malta, Integra Foundation, Migrants Network for Equality, Emigrants’ Commission, GetUpStandUp, Organisation for Friendship in Diversity, KOPIN, Foundation for Shelter and Support to Migrants.14th March 2017:Gordon Pickard, a former soldier who was charged with the murder of an escaped detainee, has this morning appeared in court testifying against two other soldiers who are facing the same charges over an incident which occurred in 2012.The 37-year-old Lance Bombardier from Zabbar was called to testify before magistrate Consuelo Scerri Herrera in the case against Sergeant Mark Anthony Dimech and Gunner Clive Cuschieri. The case revolves round the investigation into the death of escaped Malian migrant, 32-year-old Mamadou Kamara.Mr Kamara had died in the back of a detention service van after being repeatedly kicked in the groin. Forensic expert Mario Scerri had established that the Malian had died as a result of the blunt trauma he sustained, which in turn triggered a vasovagal attack.Back in November 2015, the Court of Criminal Appeal presided by Judge Edwina Grima, overturned Mr Pickard's conviction for suppressing evidence, holding that he had been convicted of the wrong offence.Taking to the witness stand this morning, Mr Pickard said that at the time of the murder, he was stationed at Hal Safi detention centre and had been in charge of the 12 man shift on duty at the time of Mr Kamara's death. He explained that the staff included detention officers and members of AFM.He told the court that Sergeant Mark Anthony Dimech was the lance bombardier in charge of that shift.Asked to explain what actions would be taken against inmates who caused trouble, he said that usually, troublemakers would be put in isolation, a small cell with iron bars. He said this would be used both for medical isolations and misbehaviour cases.It would be the person in charge who takes the decision to put someone in isolation, in this case, Mr Dimech. It appears that on the day of the alleged murder, Kamara was causing trouble and the other inmates would not want him close to them.He told the court that on that day, his shift started at around 6:20pm at block B. Mr Casha had given him a hand over and told him they were taking care of an immigrant who was mentally unstable. He was told the migrant was ""crazy, taking people's things and at one point even asked for a joint.""Questioned by Inspector Keith Arnaud, the man said he did not inform Sgt. Dimech of the trouble which erupted as he wanted to investigate the case himself. He informed Mr Dimech of the matter at around 8:30pm.The witness recalled how Mr Kamara had asked to be taken to the polyclinic. Pickard, Dimech and Cuschieri had driven the man to a polyclinic. The detainee was placed in a cage in the back of the van.When asked to describe the man's behaviour, Mr Pickard said that the Malian was misbehaving. After 45 minutes the doctors certified him as healthy but made an appointment for a psychiatrist to see him the next day.When they returned him to B Block, a commotion broke out because the other immigrants didn't want him back. They said, the witness explained, they were scared that he was going to hurt them.Mr Pickard said that it was Mr Dimech's decision to have the man locked up in the isolation room.""I opened the gate to let him out while another immigrant was talking to Mr Dimech. At this point I had the gate keys in my hand. Then, Mr Kamara suddenly ran off.""The witness said he chased the detainee for around 200 metres but Mr Kamara had then jumped over the fence. The officers had gone out in a detention centre van to try and recapture the escaped migrant.Mr Pickard joined the search team some ten minutes later using his personal car. On his way back, he saw Mr Kamara climbing a wall in a side street. He stopped to tell him to halt. Mr Kamara said something which the witness did not understand and he leapt over the wall. At this point, he told Mr Dimech to go around because he was going to go over the next wall.The search carried on until he saw gunner Cuschieri kick the man twice in the abdomen and head. ""I told him to slow down while Kamara had been lashing out at the officers with his arms and legs"", he explained. The migrant was eventually placed in an armlock as they had no handcuffs available at the time.""Kamara struggled as he was being placed in the van. Dimech held his legs while I held one of his arms. Cuschieri closed the cage. Sgt. Dimech and I put him in the back of the van. When we sat him down in the van he attacked us again.""The witness then called the detention centre to ensure handcuffs were ready at the gate. When they arrived at Safi detention centre, Dimech had cuffed Kamara's feet whilst the other soldiers cuffed his hands. They drove to Paola polyclinic after that.Mr Dimech went to see a doctor as he had bruises to treat. Mr Pickard, in the meantime, went to get a wheelchair. He got back to the van some time later and saw that the immigrant lay unresponsive.""With experience we know that sometimes immigrants don't answer and wait for us to open the door to escape. I called the doctor down and when he arrived he said the migrant's dead.""The witness said that Clive Cuschieri kicked the immigrant as he was trying to get up, he said. Defence lawyer Stephen Tonna Lowell objected to the prosecution making reference to a statement made by Cuschieri in the absence of a lawyer. But inspector Arnoud said he had released the statement after consulting with a lawyer.""I had released a second statement after being reminded about something which I left out of the first statement"", said Pickard. Asked to clarify what it was that he had been reminded about, he said that it was about Cuschieri kicking the immigrant. He insisted that he had forgotten to mention it the first time.Lawyer Joe Giglio then led the cross-examination and asked about Dimech's decision to put Kamara in isolation. ""10 years of experience had taught us what to do in these circumstances. We didn't have time to consult our superiors. Mr Dimech came down to try and calm the situation down as the immigrants were all shaking the bars and banging on them aggressively.""""If we hadn't placed him in isolation, I don't know what would have happened,"" the witness insisted.The lawyer then asked about the escape. Mr Pickard explained that the victim had ignored orders to stop. When specifically asked about the kicking, he said it was all very confusing. Case continues in April.

Il suo cadavere è stato trovato questa mattina sulla spiaggia di contrada Pisciotto a Licata, un litorale dell'agrigentino affollato di bagnanti nel periodo estivo. Ma la notte scorsa non c'era nessuno ad aiutarlo quando un gruppo di scafisti senza scrupoli gli hanno intimato di gettarsi in acqua insieme a decine di migranti, molti dei quali giovanissimi come lui. È annegato a pochi metri dalla riva, mentre i suoi compagni si dileguavano nell'oscurità. Una ventina di migranti, intercettati dalle forze dell'ordine nelle campagne della zona, hanno riferito che su quel gommone erano una ottantina. La speranza è che tutti siano riusciti a mettersi in salvo, dandosi poi alla macchia.Le motovedette della Guardia Costiera hanno perlustrato per tutta la giornata il tratto di mare dove è avvenuta la tragedia senza tuttavia avvistare altri cadaveri. I superstiti, tra i quali otto minorenni che hanno detto di essere egiziani, sono stati accompagnati in una struttura d'accoglienza a Licata. Agli investigatori hanno raccontato di essersi imbarcati su una nave «madre» e di essere stati costretti a salire su un gommone prima di essere abbandonati dagli scafisti nei pressi della spiaggia, senza tuttavia rivelare il porto di partenza della traversata. La procura di Agrigento ha già aperto un'inchiesta sulla tragedia, affidata al sostituto Santo Fornasier. Gli inquirenti non escludono un collegamento con quanto accaduto stamani a Malta, dove 52 magrebini sono stati bloccati prima di imbarcarsi su due barconi diretti verso le coste siciliane.Secondo questa ricostruzione gli scafisti responsabili dello sbarco della notte scorsa potrebbero appartenere alla stessa organizzazione che gestirebbe la tratta di immigrati sulla rotta Malta-Sicilia. Nelle ultime settimane sono infatti ripresi gli arrivi di migranti magrebini, sopratutto tunisini ed egiziani, sulle coste della Sicilia sud occidentale.

Die Regierung von Unterfranken bestätigte den Todesfall auf epd-Anfrage. Man gehe von einem Suizid aus. Weitere Angaben wollte ein Sprecher wegen der laufenden Ermittlungen nicht machen.Nach Angaben der ""Internationalen Föderation Iranischer Flüchtlinge"" hatten Mitbewohner den Sicherheitsdienst darüber informiert, dass sich der Mann in Selbstmordabsicht in seinem Zimmer eingeschlossen habe. Die Mitarbeiter hätten vergeblich versucht, in das Zimmer des Mannes zu gelangen. Auch die Polizei konnte die schwere Eisentür nicht öffnen. Dies sei erst der herbeigerufenen Feuerwehr gelungen, doch zu diesem Zeitpunkt sei der Mann bereits tot gewesen.Regierungssprecher Johannes Hardenacke bestätigte den Ablauf der Rettungsversuche am Montag auf epd-Anfrage. Er betonte, ""dass nach bisherigem Kenntnisstand keinerlei Zusammenhang zwischen dem Suizid und Art und Weise der Unterbringung besteht"". Die Organisation hatte behauptet, Grund für den Selbstmord sei die ""menschenunwürdige Situation"" in der Gemeinschaftsunterkunft gewesen. Laut Hardenacke habe es ähnliche Vorfälle in Würzburg seit Jahren nicht gegeben.Der Würzburger Arzt August Stich, der sich mit seinem Team von der Missionsärztlichen Klinik um die medizinische Versorgung der Flüchtlinge in der Gemeinschaftsunterkunft kümmert, sagte, die psychisch labile Konstitution des Mannes sei seit Monaten bekannt gewesen.

Vom Medizinischen Dienst lägen für den 29-Jährigen ""keine Atteste"" vor. Laut Stich sei die psychisch desolate Situation des Mannes der Verwaltung ""selbstverständlich bekannt"" gewesen, aus eben diesem Grund habe man ihm ja auch gestattet, seine Schwester zu besuchen und das Bundesland Bayern zu verlassen, erklärte der Mediziner.Für Stich ist der Tod ""kein Einzelfall"", etliche der Bewohner seien von Folter traumatisiert und müssten nun trotzdem in ehemaligen Kasernen leben. ""Die Gemeinschaftsunterkünfte machen krank"", sagte er. Kein Bundesland gehe so schlecht mit Flüchtlingen um wie Bayern. Für ihn und seine Mitarbeiter gehe es nun darum, die vielen anderen psychisch angeschlagenen Menschen in der Würzburger Gemeinschaftsunterkunft vor Nachahmungstaten abzuhalten: ""Suizid ist keine Lösung.""Eine Sprecherin des bayerischen Sozialministeriums wies die Vorwürfe auf epd-Anfrage zurück. Bereits jetzt lebten im Freistaat ""etwa 50 Prozent"" der Asylbewerber und Asylberechtigten in Privatwohnungen. Bayern halte sich an die Bundesgesetze und sehe ""keinen Grund, davon abzuweichen"", erklärte die Sprecherin. Aus medizinischen oder auch familiären Gründen sei überdies laut Gesetz eine Auszugsgestattung möglich. Diese sei bei der jeweiligen Bezirksregierung zu beantragten.Laut der ""Internationalen Föderation Iranischer Flüchtlinge"" war der Iraner verheiratet und Vater eines Kindes, Ehefrau und Kind lebten jedoch weiter im Iran.

01/01/2012,in 2012,14,N.N.,unknown,died over the course of 2012 in Norwegian reception centres,"Coalition condemns asylum seeker policyPublished on Wednesday, 3rd April, 2013 at 10:49 under the news category, by Shruti Chauhan. Last Updated on 3rd April 2013 at 11:08. Norwegian Socialist Left Party (SV) politicians slam authorities’ attitude towards asylum seekers amongst several fatalities at Norway’s reception centers.22 deaths were recorded at these facilities last year, with at least nine being reported as unnatural, reports NRK. Oddny Miljeteig, group leader for SV in Bergen – part of the tri-partite coalition – is contrite about the present government’s policies.“In my opinion, Norwegian authorities assume that asylum seekers lie to come to Norway as a kind of Promised Land.  It is an ugly and discriminating assumption which makes me ashamed of my country,” she said to The Foreigner.Whilst asylum reception center resident numbers were 19,000 in 2009, they decreased to 15,000 last year. The nine fatalities in 2012 involved suicide homicide, and accidents, though the Directorate of Immigration (UDI) does not officially list the cause of death.According to NRK, the Norwegian Organization for Asylum Seekers (NOAS) has visited over 70 reception centers. General Secretary Ann-Magrit Austenå told the broadcaster they believe an increasing number of asylum seekers have suicidal thoughts.What explains the rise in deaths?“I am not qualified to answer that question, though I think the causes most likely are severe psychiatric/mental problems, feelings of hopelessness and insecurities about their futures and fear of being sent back to war and persecution,” answered Oddny Miljeteig.“They fear for their lives, for their future, for their children’s future.  They live through severe mental distress when they have to stay for a long time in these centers. Many of them have to live there for a long time with no certainty of their future, even after having been accepted/granted asylum,” she added, criticizing the scarcity of healthcare and treatment for psychiatric problems.She also explains that believes that many have experienced their applications for asylum denied once or twice but still dare not go back to the country they fled from. Authorities’ seemingly superficial consideration of their applications is part of the picture too.“It’s not racism, as maybe considered by few. It is a fact, however, that both Norwegian political Parties and authorities convey a strict and illiberal immigration, refugee and asylum policy.  The policy is so strict and inhuman that even the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child is overruled. Moreover, the UN has downgraded Norway when it comes to the practice of human rights,” said Ms Miljeteig.What measures need to be taken to ensure that the death rates do not increase in 2013?“Proper health treatment, more humane treatment towards asylum seekers overall, and a change in attitude from the authorities towards them. The authorities have to recognize the fear and reasons asylum seekers present them with.”At the same time, the UDI has declared in cannot do anything more than it is doing already.“I disagree. Much can be done in the terms of health treatment, for instance. And the asylum reception centers should not be commercial and based on profit, but public and non-commercial so that all money could be spent for the benefit of the asylum seekers,” the SV politician declared.The UDI dealing with the situation more sensitively, including listing the causes of death, could change the situation for the better, believes Oddny Miljeteig.“I think the UDI and Norwegian authorities really should face these deaths and their causes so that our policy could be changed into a policy to save the life and health of every asylum seeker. Nothing less should be our aim.”What would you like to pass on to these asylum seekers?“My message is mostly to Norwegian authorities, I think. Nonetheless, I want to encourage asylum seekers to seek help for problems in the centers, and speak out when they need help and assistance for physical or mental problems,” she concluded.",,,,Norway,Foreigner/MNS,http://theforeigner.no/pages/news/coalition-condemns-asylum-seeker-policy/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,14,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,14,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,14,,3502,Klara,18/04/2017,New Entry,18/04/2017,Klara

Lo ocurrido a bordo de la precaria embarcación fue lo siguiente: cuando salieron de Libia, los traficantes pusieron a 50 jóvenes en la bodega, los demás, en cubierta. Se había establecido que, por turnos, saldrían de la bodega para coger aire, pero cuando salieron los 25 primeros la barca empezó a perder estabilidad así que los traficantes decidieron sellar la trampilla con una puerta e impedir que los otros 25 pudieran respirar.

His friends have been denied permission to identify the body, they have tried twice at the central police station because it is very important to them, but have been met with threats that the border police (PAF) will be called if they do not leave. Only a person from Calais has been allowed identify him. Clearly the police don’t find it important enough to investigate a death, but would rather spend time continuing to harass ‘foreigners’, both those with and without papers.

02/07/2011,02/07/11,1,"Muhammad Shukat (47, man)",Pakistan,died from heart attack after medical neglect in the Colnbrook Removal Centre (GB) ,"Neglect by immigration detention centre staff contributed to the death of a Pakistani asylum seeker after he suffered a heart attack, an inquest jury has found.Staff at Colnbrook Immigration Removal Centre, near Heathrow airport, failed to call 999 soon enough, to administer CPR or have a working defibrillator available, an inquest at West London coroner's court, found.Muhammad Shukat, 47, a driver from Islamabad, died following a cardiac arrest last July. His 19-year-old roommate Abdul Khan pressed the emergency buzzer 10 times over a period of almost two hours, trying but failing to get Shukat, a man he called ""uncle"", help.The UK Border Agency, which commissions Serco to run the centre, said the verdict was ""deeply worrying"" and demanded radical action to address the problems.The inquest heard that nursing staff and custody officers did respond and did carry out health checks, but did not call 999 as soon as the alarm was raised at 5.30am on 2 July. Instead, the indigestion treatment Gaviscon was administered, along with aspirin, and Shukat was told he could go and see the centre's doctor at 8am. By that time, he had had a cardiac arrest.When staff realised that Shukat's heart had stopped and brought the emergency kit, the defibrillator was missing. A nurse went to collect one but it was faulty and another one had to be fetched, causing a delay of about 15 minutes.Khan told the inquest that Shukat, a smoker, was sweating and groaning as a result of severe chest pain. Asian men are at higher risk than white ones of heart attack as are smokers.Dr Iain Brew, an independent doctor who was commissioned by the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman to produce a report reviewing the incident, told the inquest: ""A 47-year old Asian man who has chest pain, normally uncomplaining, who is known to smoke, found to be sweaty and grey, should have prompted suspicion about cardiac problems and an ambulance should have been called."" He made recommendations for improvements in healthcare practices at the centre.The jury found that healthcare staff underestimated Shukat's cardiac problems and that if they had called 999 earlier and had a working defibrillator in the emergency bag his life may have been saved. Khan says he is still extremely distressed by the incident. He was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder following Shukat's death.""I was not an anxious person before but now I'm anxious and easily frightened. I had never seen such a thing in my life before,"" he said.The UK Border Agency said: ""We have demanded the strongest possible action by the contractors to address the failings highlighted by this case.The findings of the inquest are deeply worrying and we will consider them in detail."" He added that any contractors failing to deliver would be ""held to account"" and that work had begun to make changes to healthcare systems.A Serco spokesman said that steps had been taken to rectify and address the issues raised in the inquest. ""All the recommendations made in the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman report have been implemented,"" he said.",51.4835,-0.5221,Harmondsworth,GB,GuardianUn,https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/may/25/detention-centre-death-asylum-seeker,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,2831,Klara,21/06/2017,OK,28/06/2012,Nora

He was carried unconscious into an isolation cell where he remained on the ground for about an hour.When Ms Camilleri and Bdr Simiana checked on him he was found to be unconscious and died on his way to hospital after suffering from a heart attack.Police Inspector Keith Arnaud told Magistrate Saviour Demicoli the three officers were charged with manslaughter as it resulted that the migrant did not die as a direct result of the injuries he sustained during the beating.Mr Azzopardi was being held responsible for the alleged beating while Bdr Simiana and Ms Camilleri had to answer for failing to check whether the victim needed to see a doctor before he was placed in the isolation cell, which fell under their responsibility.--In 2017 it was reported that all three accused were acquitted of the charge of manslaughter.",35.833333,14.485,Ħal Safi,Malta,TimesM/MNS/MaltaToday,http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20140207/local/Three-charged-over-migrant-s-arrest-death.505786,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,3016,Klara,03/11/2017,New Entry,10/03/2014,Babs

Amongst them were 72 people of Ethiopian, Eritrean, Nigerian, Ghanaian and Sudanese origin who boarded a dinghy bound for Italy during the early hours of 27 March. A few hours after their departure, a French patrol plane flew over their boat and informed the Italian coastguards of its location. The migrants’ voyage soon turned into a nightmare. They lacked fuel, food and drinking water and lost control of the boat. They managed to send an appeal for assistance by telephone that was picked up by Italian coastguards and passed on to boats in the area, indicating their location. These distress calls were repeated every 4 hours for 10 days. Military forces with sophisticated equipment were present in Libyan waters at the time. On two occasions, helicopters flew over the migrants’ boat. One of them even dropped a few bottles of water and biscuits for the passengers before flying off again.9 days later, when many of the passengers were already dead, the migrants encountered a military ship. They signalled their distress and showed the bodies of the dead babies. Yet no-one came to their assistance. After drifting for 2 weeks, their dinghy washed up on Libyan shores. There were 11 survivors, 2 of whom died shortly after landing in Libya (one immediately upon reaching land, the other in prison after Gaddafi’s forces arrested the migrants and detained them for 4 days). 63 people, including 20 women and 3 children, were left to die.This tragedy, which symbolises Europe’s indifference to migrants and refugees, is today the subject of a complaint lodged before the French criminal courts in the names of 4 of the survivors. With the support of several NGOs, a complaint “against persons unknown” was filed before the section of the Paris High Court (Tribunal de grande instance) specialising in military cases, on the grounds of failure to assist persons in danger. It will be up to the French courts to clarify the responsibility of the French military which, whilst intervening in Libya in order to protect the civilian population, failed to assist these individuals. Having received the distress calls, the evidence indicates that the French armed forces failed in their national and international obligations to protect lives.",32.496337,14.600045,Zliten,Libya,GuardianUn/MUGAK/ELM/VDG/Raz/ABC/AVUI/PerCat/VK/SUR/Publico/ElDia/ELC/Diario Vasco/PACE/Verdad/Migreurop/UNHCR/ECRE/br2/AFP/HRW,https://www.fidh.org/en/issues/migrants-rights/Death-of-63-migrants-in-the,63,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,63,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,63,,,,,,,,,,,,,63,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,63,,,,,63,,,,,,,,,,,,,2730,Klara,22/06/2017,OK,31/01/2012,Nora
08/04/2011,08/04/11,1,"Kambiz Roustayi (36, man)",Iran,"failed asylum seeker, set himself on fire in Amsterdam (NL) out of fear of deportation","On Wednesday, Kambiz Roustayi set himself on fire on Dam Square in Amsterdam’s city centre. A day later the 36-year-old Iranian died of his injuries. A friend of his, Parvis Noshirrani told Dutch television that Mr Roustayi talked about committing suicide when they were in an asylum centre together. But he received no help from the Dutch authorities.“He was fed up with the situation. Roaming the city, sleeping in the streets. No status, no travel documents, no future. If he had returned to Iran, he probably faced the same fate. He was scared of being arrested and executed,” Mr Noshirrani told current affairs programme Nieuwsuur.PressureMr Noshirrani had to break the tragic news to Mr Roustayi’s family in Iran. His self-immolation was filmed on mobile phones. Mr Roustayi had been in the Netherlands for 11 years and expected to be deported. He fled to the Netherlands after he says he published articles in Iran which the authorities disapproved of. His requests for asylum failed each time.Mr Roytayi’s lawyer Frank van Haren saw that his client was under severe mental pressure.“He would look at me for a long time. Sometimes he would interrupt a conversation in which we were being positive by saying, ‘Do you really believe that?’ There were all kinds of signs.”ResponsibilityMr Roustayi announced he was planning to commit suicide at a meeting with civil servants on 25 March at the asylum centre. But his friend Mr Noshirrani says he was not taken seriously and was not given help. Earlier this week, he wanted to jump in front of a train, but his friend persuaded him not to.Mr Van Haren is also very critical of the Dutch authorities: “The authorities may be right to reject an asylum request and deport an asylum seeker, but if he is still here after eight or ten years and you see him deteriorating, and become mentally finished, only physically okay, there comes a time when the authorities have to take responsibility. You cannot just show someone the door.”Legal assistanceMr Roustayi’s act of desperation had a clear goal, says Mr Noshirrani. “He wanted to save other lives by ending his own. There are plenty of people in asylum centres, there are plenty of people who are deported without mercy.”Immigration and Asylum Minister Gerd Leers called Mr Roustayi’s death ‘very tragic’, but says all the procedures were followed correctly and that the man was given proper legal assistance.Second deathThe Iranian embassy in The Hague says it is regrettable that an Iranian citizen abroad finds himself in such a difficult position that he kills himself. The Netherlands should in their words improve the ‘unacceptable situation of immigrants’. The embassy says it’s the second death in a week. It is not clear who the first case was. The Iranian embassy was unavailable for comment this morning.",52.370216,4.895168,Amsterdam,Netherlands,NBK/VK/Eindhovens Dagblad/IMA/MNS/RNW/Blackbox,https://www.rnw.org/archive/netherlands-failed-help-self-immolation-victim,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2681,Klara,22/06/2017,OK,27/04/2011,Natasha

01/03/2011,01/03/11,1,"Shambu Lama (40, man)",Nepal,"lay on train tracks in Gifhorn (DE) out of fear of deportation, had spent 16 years in Germany","HILDESHEIM taz | Eine Handvoll junger Männer, sie alle stammen aus Nepal, sind zu der Einäscherung erschienen. Nun stehen sie vor dem Trauerraum und werden von dem Bestattungsunternehmer gewarnt. ""Sie können gleich sitzen oder stehen, das überlasse ich Ihnen, dazu weiß ich zu wenig über Ihre Kultur"", sagt er. ""Aber tun Sie sich einen Gefallen und lassen sie den Sarg geschlossen. Sie wissen ja, was mit ihm geschehen ist.""Die Sonne lässt die pastellfarbenen Wände des Krematoriums leuchten. Das Feuerbestattungsinstitut steht in einem Hildesheimer Gewerbegebiet, umringt von einem Vertrieb für Fräsen und einem Laborwagen-Hersteller. Die Nepalesen machen Fotos von Nadine Tannenberg, dem Sarg und einem kleinen Kind, das die junge Frau auf dem Arm trägt. Es heißt Joshua Chris und ist der Sohn des 40-jährigen abgelehnten Asylbewerbers Shambhu Lama. ""Die Behörden haben ihn in den Tod getrieben"", sagt Tannenberg, nachdem Lamas Sarg in der Brennkammer verschwunden ist.Später sitzt neben ihr am gedeckten Kaffeetisch Bija Mokthan und wühlt in einem Umschlag. ""Das sollten alles wir bezahlen"", sagt er und reicht ein Papier herüber. Mokhta ist Sprecher des Nepalesischen Kulturvereins und der Preis, der auf den Zetteln kalkuliert wird, ist der für die letzte Reise seines Landsmanns Lama.Wenn es nach dem deutschen Staat geht, dann hätte der die Heimreise schon 1996 antreten sollen. Da wurde sein Asylantrag abgelehnt. Doch erst kürzlich bekamen die Behörden das für Lamas Abschiebung nötige Papier. Am 3. März sollten Bundespolizisten ihn nach Kathmandu bringen - obwohl er im Einvernehmen mit Tannenberg den Umgang mit seinem Sohn pflegte.Lama hatte die Gerichte auf seiner Seite. Trotzdem kündigte die Ausländerbehörde Gifhorn ihm am 1. März die Rückführung nach Nepal an. Nach 15 Jahren Kampf um sein Bleiberecht war Lama psychisch am Ende. Nun wird er nächste Woche in einer Weißblechurne der Firma Völsing in seine Heimat fliegen. Das war die billigere Variante. Einen Sarg nach Nepal zu schicken hätte 6.000 Euro gekostet. Die hatte Mokhtas Verein nicht, auch wenn die Bundesregierung am Ende Geld zuschoß.Lama lebte in Deutschland als Geduldeter - ohne Arbeitserlaubnis, untergebracht in Sammelunterkünften, versorgt mit Gutscheinen für 184 Euro im Monat. Im August 2009 lernten er und Tannenberg sich in einer Pizzeria in Königslutter kennen. ""Er war ein sehr höflicher Mann, wir haben uns gut verstanden"", sagt sie. Kurz darauf wurde sie schwanger. Die Beziehung fand ein Ende, doch Tannenberg, ihr neuer Freund und Lama waren sich einig: ""Shambhu sollte Umgang mit seinem Sohn haben, das war uns allen wichtig.""Im Mai 2010 wurde das Kind geboren. Lama lebte damals im Flüchtlingswohnheim Meinersen. Dessen Bewohner klagen seit langem über einen schikanösen Umgang der Ausländerbehörde. Es liegt nicht weit von Tannenbergs Wohnort entfernt, doch dazwischen sind zwei Landkreisgrenzen, die Lama wegen der Residenzpflicht für Asylbewerber nicht überschreiten durfte. ""Die Ausländerbehörde hat immer Schwierigkeiten gemacht, wenn er eine Besuchserlaubnis wollte"", sagt Tannenberg.Gegenüber der Ausländerbehörde und dem Jugendamt gab sie an, dass Lama der Vater ihres Kindes war, 2010 erkannte der die Vaterschaft offiziell an. Doch die Ausländerbehörde zweifelte und weigerte sich, ihm ein Aufenthaltsrecht zu geben. Am 24. Februar zog Lama vor Gericht.Vier Tage später, am Tag vor seinem Tod, besuchte er Tannenberg und seinen Sohn ein letztes Mal. ""Wir waren Kaffee trinken, er hat mit seinen Gutscheinen Windeln gekauft"", sagt sie. Am nächsten Morgen ging er zur Ausländerbehörde und erfuhr: Zwei Tage später wollte man ihn in ein Flugzeug setzen. ""An dem Tag hat er mich angerufen, und gefragt, ob es etwas Neues vom Gericht gibt"", sagt Lamas Anwältin Daniela Öndül.Es gab nichts Neues. Um 14.14 Uhr bekam Tannenberg eine letzte SMS: ""Gott hat es so gewollt. Ich kann Euch nicht wiedersehen, aber bis zum letzten Atemzug wünsche Ich Euch alles Gute."" Um 15.40 Uhr beobachteten zwei Schülerinnen auf dem Gifhorner Bahnhof, wie Lama vom Gleis herabstieg und seinen Kopf auf die Schienen legte, als ein Güterzug herannahte.Öndül hat jetzt eine Dienstaufsichtsbeschwerde gegen zwei Sachbearbeiter der Gifhorner Ausländerbehörde eingereicht: Sie hätten Öndül angelogen, Lamas Vaterschaft trotz ausreichender Nachweise ignoriert und seine Abschiebung vorbereitet, obwohl das Verwaltungsgericht Braunschweig sie aufgefordert hatte, dies zu unterlassen. ""Noch am Tag seines Todes und wider besseren Wissens"" hätten die Sachbearbeiter Lama prophezeit, sein Antrag vor Gericht werde keinen Erfolg haben. Stattdessen werde man ihn nach Kathmandu abschieben. Diese Ankündigung habe Lama, so schreibt Öndül, ""in eine psychisch so aussichtslose Lage gebracht, dass er sich schließlich das Leben nahm"". Zwei Wochen später entschied das Verwaltungsgericht Braunschweig, dass Lama ein Aufenthaltsrecht zugestanden hat. Genützt hat dies nur noch Öndül: Ihr Honorar muss der Landkreis Gifhorn bezahlen.Der äußerte sich am gestrigen Mittwoch nicht. Kurz nach dem Tod hatte Landrätin Marion Lau verbreiten lassen, die Gründe für Lamas Suizid seien ""im persönlichen Umfeld zu suchen"".

23/09/2010,23/09/10,1,"Bertha Penetes Acosta (74, w)",Columbia,"died in expulsion centre after arrest, had been living without documents in Netherlands for decades","20 jaar illegaal in NederlandKruispunt vertelt het bijzondere levensverhaal van de 74-jarige Bertha Puentes Acosta. Deze kleurrijke Columbiaanse is een bekende verschijning in Amsterdam. Ze verblijft al meer dan 20 jaar illegaal in Nederland en leidt hier een zwervend bestaan. Ze reist met een koffertje en een gitaar van plek naar plek. In april dit jaar wordt ze in licht verwarde toestand aangehouden. Een paar maanden later overlijdt ze in een cel. Hoe kon dit gebeuren?AppeltaartVrienden en kleinkinderen vertellen in Kruispunt over de periode dat Bertha illegaal in Nederland was. Kleinzoon David: “Ze was geen oma-oma die appeltaarten en koekjes bakte. Maar ze was lief en ik kon met haar lachen. Ze was meer een vriend. Ze logeerde regelmatig een paar dagen bij ons en trok dan weer verder. Oma Bertha kon niet lang op één plek blijven. Ze genoot teveel van haar vrijheid en onafhankelijkheid. Ze kent alle adresjes waar ze goedkoop kan eten en koffiedrinken. De Columbiaanse spreekt nauwelijks Nederlands maar weet met behulp van haar gitaar, haar charme en humor makkelijk vrienden te maken.IllegaalBertha Puentes is illegaal in Nederland. In Columbia werkte ze als verpleegkundige en ze trad ook op als zangeres en flamenco danseres. Na een overval besluit haar familie haar naar Nederland te halen. Bertha heeft een zoon die hier een gezin heeft gesticht. Met vijf Nederlandse kleinkinderen denkt de familie dat het oma Bertha wel zal lukken om een verblijfsvergunning te krijgen. Maar dat blijkt minder makkelijk dan gedacht.Kamp ZeistBertha verhuist regelmatig van kamer naar kamer. Elke zondag gaat ze naar de Nicolaaskerk naar een dienst voor Spaanstaligen. Ze woont ruim tien jaar in Nederland wanneer de politie haar op een ongelukkige dag treft. Bertha is in de war en probeert de snelweg over te steken. Dan blijkt dat haar papieren niet in orde zijn. De Columbiaanse gaat naar het detentiecentrum Kamp Zeist. Amnesty International bezoekt haar daar en schrikt van haar slechte medische toestand. Bertha heeft een opgezet blauw been, is verward en depressief. Kamp Zeist is niet uitgerust om goed voor Bertha te zorgen, maar wat moet er dan met haar gebeuren? Via Rotterdam gaat ze uiteindelijk naar het uitzetcentrum Ter Apel.Illegaliteit niet strafbaarOp 23 september 2010 overlijdt Bertha Puentes Acosta in Ter Apel, 74 jaar oud. Naar de doodsoorzaak loopt op dit moment een onderzoek. Haar dood heeft veel maatschappelijke onrust veroorzaakt. De PvdA heeft inmiddels kamervragen gesteld. Waarom moest Bertha opgesloten worden? Amnesty noemt de opsluiting van Bertha in strijd met de mensenrechten, omdat iIllegaliteit geen strafbaar feit is. Amnesty roept de Nederlandse regering daarom op vreemdelingendetentie alleen toe te passen als er geen alternatieven zijn.

You don’t have to learn the language and you are in Europe, the assumed paradise. That’s what Wahabou thought when he was a teenager. He and his family came all the way from Senegal to live a life in Paris, the capital of France. According to Wahabou the most beautiful city of the world.Around 5 years ago Wahabou got the shock of his life. His sister called him that he had to come home quickly. The building, where he, his family and other illegal immigrants lived, was on fire! ‘The first image I saw was my mother coming down from the 4th floor, on the fireman's ladder.’ Twenty persons died in that fire. Living a life in Paris as an illegal immigrant can sometimes be very dangerous. Because of this Wahabou founded an organization after the fire, in memory of the people who did not survive. He goes to unsafe buildings, hangs up smoke detectors and trains the inhabitants how to act in case of a fire.

The person was the brother of a witness at the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. His brother had been put in a witness protection programme. Despite Mr Kosanovic’s life being threatened in Serbia, the national Immigration and Naturalisation Service (IND) decided that it did not concern political persecution and ultimately rejected his appeal for asylum. The IND claims it made a proper assessment and reiterated that its decision was backed up by the Court in Den Bosch and the State Council. Kosanovic was killed in broad day light in his hometown of Šid by a man who had threatened and beaten him before he fled to the Netherlands. Source: NOS, 24 November 2012",45.125799,19.228288,Sid,Serbia,NOS/PICUM,http://nos.nl/artikel/444047-afgewezen-asielzoeker-vermoord.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,3486,Klara,30/03/2017,New Entry,30/03/2017,Klara

Ils sont montés à bord d’un bateau battant pavillon panaméen qui accostait au port d’Alger. Deux des trois jeunes hommes qui s’étaient dirigés vers la partie avant du bateau et ouvert une porte en fer menant à la soute, avaient réussi à descendre alors que la victime Kalkouli Amine tenait la porte, lorsque le prévenu, chargé alors de la surveillance du bateau, l’avait aperçu. Ce dernier avait fermé la porte avec force sur Kalkouli, qui tomba d’une hauteur de 15 m sur un tas de ferraille.Selon la même source, les deux jeunes criaient pour qu’on leur ouvre la porte en fer pour secourir la victime Kalkouli, mais aucun membre de l’équipage n’était intervenu avant une heure. La victime a été évacuée, par la suite, à l’hôpital où elle a succombé à ses blessures.

09/05/2008,09/05/08,1,"Abdelhakim Ajimi (22, man)",Africa,died in police custody under unclear circumstances after being arrested in Grasse (F),"June 5, 2008 — NewsWritten by Virginia MacFadyen	A death in police custody in south-east France is causing community concern.Behind a banner proclaiming ‘police blunder, assassins’, hundreds of people, a thousand perhaps (according to the organisers), took part in a largely silent demonstration (except when marching past the police station) on Sunday 11 May in the centre of the south-eastern city of Grasse (Alpes-Maritîmes). The march was held in tribute to 22-year-old Abdelhakim Ajimi (aka Hakim) who died two days earlier, while or after being arrested in circumstances which have still not been officially ascertained.According to the daily Nice-Matin, which published the first report on 10 May, an altercation grew out of the refusal of the young man’s bank branch (at Crédit Agricole) to allow him to withdraw money. He got angry and the police, alerted by the bank manager, intervened. According to Dominique Vian, the Alpes-Maritimes Prefect, a violent struggle ensued, wounding two police officers, one of whom was hospitalised with a collarbone fracture. In the Prefect’s press release, published only one day after the death of Hakim when his family and supporters were marching in Grasse in tribute to him, Dominique Vian defended the conduct of the officers carrying out the arrest, stating: ‘Nothing that took place would lead me to question the actions of the police.’Michel Henry, writing in Libération on 12 May, reports that Hakim’s support committee explained that the young man was unemployed and angry at not being able to receive unemployment payments for two months. When his efforts to withdraw money were refused, he exploded in anger, prompting the bank’s director to summon the police (BAC- Brigade anti-criminalité).According to Mr Vian’s press release, the police quickly located the young man on the Boulevard Victor-Hugo, attempted to arrest him and when he again flew into a rage, a shop window was broken, and a policeman was wounded. Then, according to the Prefect, Hakim was finally controlled and handcuffed.Challenge to police version of eventsSeveral witnesses, however, challenged the police report on the death, stating that it was after he was handcuffed that things got out of hand. Corroborating testimony from a secondary school student, 17-year-old Layla Picout, and a 30-year-old dog handler, Ludovic Gérard, indicates that at the very least the attitude of the three policemen to Abdelhakim Ajimi alarmed the witnesses and appeared violent and disproportionate. According to Gérard, interviewed by Dimanche Nice-Matin: ‘His face was against the ground, three policemen were on top of him. He was handcuffed under his body. Pressure was applied to his spine. I heard the young man say he could not breathe. He was purple. One of the three policemen hit him with his fists.’ Ludovic Gérard, talked about ‘the lawful beating’ on France Info radio. Speaking to Libération, he said: ‘A policeman was exerting pressure on his vertebral column with his knee. Another was stifling him with his arm. He had his handcuffed hands under his torso. He was purple and begging to breathe. He got two punches instead, two good ones. I told the policemen: “You have him under control now, what more are you looking for?”‘ Another witness, Layla Picout, who knew Hakim, recounted the same story: ‘He was defenceless, pinned to the ground, completely overturned, lying stone cold as though he was already gone. He looked all soft, like a marshmallow, when he was hauled, handcuffed, into the back of their car.’ She told Dimanche Nice-Matin that ‘one of the policemen was holding him by the throat. During the twenty minutes that I was there,’ she said, ‘he did not let go of his throat. He gripped him very tightly. That image will never leave my mind.’ When the rescue services (firefighters) arrived, she said, several witnesses were shocked that the police had not let the firefighters take him to hospital. The injured policeman was taken to hospital but Hakim was transferred to the police station. Rescue services were summoned later to the police station and attempted to resuscitate Hakim, who, according to the Prefect, had fallen ill while in the police vehicle. At 4.30pm, Abdelhakim Ajimi was declared dead.The autopsy findings on the 22-year-old were ‘inconclusive’ except to exclude actual blows as a cause of death. Analyses of the heart and lungs of the victim and toxicological examinations showed possible signs of asphyxiation or a possible heart condition. A judicial inquiry for involuntary manslaughter was opened by the prosecutor’s office in Grasse to shed light on the causes and circumstances of Hakim’s death. The autopsy revealed ‘possible signs of asphyxiation’ and one of the policemen involved in the arrest admitted that he practised a ‘half-nelson strangulation hold’.Echoes of previous deathThis arrest technique is banned in some countries and France was condemned by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in October 2007, for a case which occurred in Toulon in November 1998, involving the death of Mohamed Saoud, a schizophrenic who had a violent crisis, striking out at his family. Three police officers were attacked or wounded in trying to control him. Finally, he was overcome by the police, his hands and ankles were handcuffed and he was placed on the floor on his belly, in a position similar to Hakim’s. One policeman applied pressure to his shoulders and kidneys, another held his feet, and the third, his head. After being held for half an hour in this position, he died of cardiac arrest following slow asphyxiation, similar to what the witnesses described had happened to Hakim. Michel Henry, writing in Libé Aix-Marseille (21 May 2008), reports that, according to the ECHR, Mohamed Saoud’s death occurred while he was held on the ground for over thirty minutes and handcuffed, struggling to breathe. During this time, the rescue services attended to the policemen. As a result of this ‘failure of the obligation of the state to positively protect the life of Mohamed Saoud’, France was ordered to pay a fine of 20,000 euros to the victim’s relatives. The ECHR ‘deplored the fact that no specific directive was issued by the French authorities with respect to this type of immobilisation technique’.Hakim’s death raises fresh questions over whether control and restraint techniques are being properly administered. In the view of the family lawyer, Franck de Vita, ‘the indication that there are signs of asphyxiation testify to an unnatural death and hence wrongdoing of at least one of the policemen during the arrest’. Another lawyer for the young man’s family, Sylvain Pont, when asked about the new elements that have been brought out, stated: ‘I am not here to put the police or police agents on trial. However, if it is proved, in the light of evidence and the autopsy, that the police officer in question would have had the possibility of arresting this individual without endangering his life, the judges should then consider whether a reclassification from manslaughter to assault causing death without intent is timely, placing the matter within the jurisdiction of the court of appeal.’Unanswered questionsQuestions remain: Where did the death happen – during the arrest, while being transported to the police station or on arrival there? On the day of the demonstration in support of the young man’s family and neighbours, Dominique Vian provided specific details which presented the young man as a cannabis smoker, prosecuted for having driven while intoxicated, even that he had been confined on occasions to a psychiatric hospital. Why, if it was known that Hakim had been in psychiatric care, was he not taken to hospital, but driven instead to the police station? Did the police in Grasse use a controversial immobilising technique against Hakim during his arrest? Several witnesses have raised questions over the actions taken by the police who continued, according to them, to apply pressure on the back and the neck of the young man while handcuffed, face to the ground, when he clearly could not breathe.At the demonstration on 11 May, banners proclaimed: ‘Hakim, we love you’, ‘Those who keep the peace kill our children’, ‘Police delinquency, where is the justice?’. MRAP and the League of Human Rights expressed support.According to Marc Désert, the prosecutor for the Republic in Grasse: ‘The arrest was justified. The questioning techniques were justified. Techniques of this sort are taught for use in similar circumstances. Were they mastered? It is all a matter of balance and extent. Once the person is handcuffed, should a stranglehold be maintained until the arrival of reinforcements? That is the question that the investigation magistrate must determine.’ He added: ‘But if these techniques are judged to be dangerous, the police perhaps should review what they teach.’So much community concern has been voiced that the public prosecutor’s office in Tunis has decided to open an investigation of its own. On 13 May 2008, the police union, Unsa-police, issued a press release, which, while justifying ‘police regulations’ called for ‘full light to be shed’ on the circumstances of the arrest. It also called for the Ministry of the Interior to reinforce security on the spot as a ‘precautionary measure’.",43.660153,6.926492,Grasse,France,IRR,http://www.irr.org.uk/news/a-tribute-to-abdelhakim-ajimi/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,2220,Klara,14/06/2017,New entry,16/12/2008,Imane

Repêché inconscient et en choc cardiaque après s'être jeté dans la Marne, Baba Traoré, était décédé quelques heures plus tard à l'hôpital de Lariboisière à Paris.Selon l'autopsie effectuée lundi, la noyade s'est produite après un choc thermique avec une eau à 6 degrés. «L'absence de toute lésion traumatique» a également été observée.Absence de contact physique entre Baba Traoré et les policiersUn témoin des faits, entendu dans le cadre de l'enquête confiée à l'Inspection générale des services (la police des polices) a par ailleurs confirmé l'absence de tout contact physique entre Baba Traoré et les deux policiers qui s'étaient lancés à sa poursuite.Le jeune homme de 29 ans, de nationalité malienne et résidant à Neuilly-Plaisance (Seine-Saint-Denis), était depuis janvier sous le coup d'un arrêté préfectoral de reconduite à la frontière (APRF) délivré par le préfet de Seine-Saint-Denis. Il avait pris la fuite vendredi lors d'un contrôle à la gare RER de Joinville-le-Pont, après avoir présenté une carte Navigo, quand les policiers avaient voulu vérifier son identité dans leur fichier. Il était venu en France en 2004 pour donner un rein à sa soeur.

04/10/2007,04/10/07,1,"Mike Osei (34, man)",Ghana,fell from the 7th floor running away from police check in Amsterdam (NL),"Mike Osei, a Ghanaian living in Amsterdam Bijlmer, in the Southeast district met his untimely death on Thursday, 4 October 2007 around 7 pm in front of the Gravestein building. The Police busted into the 10-storey flat, arrested one man and in his bid to run away, Osei fell from the 7th floor and died as a result of the Police action.Incidentally this sad event coincided with the 15th Anniversary of the Bijlmer Disaster in which Israeli EL AL Cargo plane crashed into a block of flats, about half a kilometer away from the spot where Mike fell, on October 4 1992. Fourteen Ghanaians, including women and children, lost their lives in this accident.Memorial ceremony in wreath-laying was already taking place in a calamity already fading into oblivion when Mike Osei fell.Circumstances surrrounding his death is still sketchy and cloudy that Ghanaians mounted a huge demonstration yesterday never before in the history of them in the Netherlands.The news is still brewing hot in both the local and the international media, thus bringing into sharp focus under the microscope, the excesses of the Dutch immigration policy fashioned out in her pandemic racial animosity towards migrants.Twenty four hours from now, a delegation made up of representatives from the Ghana Embassy in The Hague and the Interim Advisory Council for Ghanaian residents in The Netherlands, will meet the Mayor of Amsterdam, Job Cohen to ascertain the facts of the case that led to this tragic accident.There are versions of conspiracy theories including a possible Dutch Police complicity. Another theory has it that the man had just been released from jail some 10 days ago and was already suffering from trauma, intimidation and fear and, the Police harassment might have created the panic that resulted in him trying to escape another arrest.This FEAR in the African community in particular has resulted in many incidents in the past where people jumped to death or became maimed as they tried to escape Police arrest.Meanwhile arrangements and feverish preparations are underway for the burial of Mike Osei, as the entire Ghanaian Community hangs in grief and is awashed in the traditional brick red coloured 'Kobin' cloth, symbolising state of mourning.",52.352709,4.861866,Amsterdam,Netherlands,Karawane/Fabel van de Illegaal,http://thecaravan.org/node/1369,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,1962,Klara,28/03/2017,OK,27/03/2007,Roberta

26/09/2007,26/09/07,1,"Laucling Sonko (29, man)",Senegal,"manslaughter, Spanish Guard brought him back to MA cutting his inflatable mattress","The United Nations Committee Against Torture (UNCAT) has recently added its voice to the range of bodies that have reminded European Union countries that their efforts to prevent migrants and asylum seekers from entering “Fortress Europe” must respect international human rights. In its Sonko v. Spain ruling last November, UNCAT examined claims that Spanish officials had deliberately failed to protect the life of a migrant and rendered a decision in support of migrants’ rights.The case was brought by the sister of a Senegalese man, Lauding Sonko, who died in 2007 while trying to enter Spanish territory by sea. On the night of September 26, Sonko and three others attempted to enter Ceuta, the Spanish enclave on the North African coast surrounded by Moroccan territory, by swimming along the coast assisted by inflatable dinghies. According to survivors, at about 5:05 a.m., a Spanish Civil Guard vessel intercepted the migrants, and brought them on board. The Spanish Civil Guard picked them up near a Moroccan beach, and, after puncturing their dinghies, forced them to jump back into the water at a place where the water was too high for them to stand.Sonko could not swim, but was nevertheless forced into the water and left to flounder. The Civil Guard officers ignored his calls for help. By the time one eventually jumped into the water, brought him to shore and attempted to resuscitate him, it was too late. Sonko was buried in an unmarked grave in Ceuta.Spain’s examination of Sonko’s death was shelved in 2009, after a very brief investigation that consisted of taking statements from five witnesses, none of whom were survivors, and accepting the volunteered statement of one survivor. No one in Sonko’s family was notified of the Spanish investigation until 16 months after it began, and they were never party to the legal proceedings.Spain’s conduct demonstrated the minimal value it placed on Sonko’s life, and UNCAT found that it violated the Convention Against Torture (CAT). UNCAT held that Sonko was “placed in a situation that caused his death” by the Spanish Civil Guard officers who forced him into the water, and that this exceeded the threshold of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, in violation of Article 16 of the CAT. However, although UNCAT recognized that Sonko was in a particularly vulnerable position as a migrant, and that this would have aggravated his suffering, it did not rise to the level of torture. Nevertheless, based on the extremely limited nature of Spain’s investigation into Sonko’s death, UNCAT also held that Spain had also failed to undertake a prompt and full investigation into the incident, in violation of CAT Article 12.The ruling echoes the recent decision of the European Court of Human Rights in Hirsi v. Italy.  In that decision, the court ruled that where ships of a Council of Europe state intercept migrants at sea and bring them on board, the flag state of the intercepting ship assumes responsibility for those migrants, and the migrants come under protection of the European Convention on Human Rights.  It is now clear that the UN and European human rights systems have spoken with one voice, affirming that states cannot shirk their basic human rights obligations in order to prevent migrants from entering their territory by simply moving those operations out from their border to the sea.The issue of state responsibility for the lives of migrants at sea raised by this case remains vitally important, given that approximately 1,500 migrants died in the Mediterranean while trying to reach European shores in 2011, according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. This was the highest number of deaths since the UNHCR started keeping such statistics in 2006. The most egregious example of a failure to respond to obligations to assist migrants in trouble occurred in March 2011, during the Nato air campaign against Libya, when Nato naval failed to rescue a boat of 72 migrants, leading to the death of 63.In a step towards preventing serious violations of the human rights of migrants, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) recently decided in Hirsi v. Italy that where ships of a Council of Europe state intercept migrants at sea and bring them on board, the flag state of the intercepting ship assumes responsibility for those migrants, and the migrants come under protection of the European Convention on Human Rights.",35.321136,-2.94977,Melilla,Spain,Guardian Un./Statewatch/Telegraph/Picum/ELM/MUGAK/EP/Publico/MNS/Can7/ABC/LV/OSF,https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/voices/case-watch-un-committee-faults-spain-migrant-death-case,1,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,1,,,,,1,,,,,,,,2087,Dorien,01-05-2018,OK,02/04/2008,Imane

Mais les pompiers n'ont pu le ranimer. Il s'agit du premier suicide au centre de rétention du Canet, selon la Cimade (service oecuménique d'entraide).« Personne n'est venu »Un codétenu tunisien, sous le coup d'un arrêté de reconduite à la frontière, ne s'explique pas ce qui est arrivé. « On ne comprend pas ce qui s'est passé.

25/08/2004,25/08/04,1,"Amor Knis (35, man)",Tunisia,"stowaway, body found in trunk of his girlfriend’s car in Genoa (I) after 30h trip from Tunisia"," Tunisino muore nel bagagliaio dell'auto della fidanzata italianaGENOVA.Avevano già i documenti per sposarsi. Il loro era un amore nato circa tre anni fa. Ma Amor Knis, tunisino di 35 anni, aitante animatore di villaggi turistici, non ce l'ha fatta a veder ripartire la sua donna, Daniela V., bresciana di 32 anni, impiegata nell'azienda del padre, che doveva rientrare in Italia assieme ai suoi due bambini di 5 e 8 anni (avuti da una precedente relazione).Amor Knis, dopo 20 giorni di felicità trascorsi a Djerba, ha convito la donna e nel porto di Tunisi si è fatto chiudere nel portabagagli dell'auto, una Volkswagen Golf, per raggiungere con lei l'Italia. Non avendo il permesso di soggiorno ha deciso di affrontare il viaggio da clandestino sul traghetto Victory. Un viaggio che gli è costato la vita. L'uomo, nato a Zarzis, amante del windsurf, kayak, munito di patente nautica e che parlava sei lingue, è morto. Ed è stata proprio Daniela che, all'arrivo nel porto di Genova, dopo circa 30 ore di viaggio, ha scoperto che il suo uomo, rimasto dentro il portabagagli per tutto quel tempo, era morto soffocato. La giovane bresciana, dopo un primo momento di smarrimento, è crollata davanti ai poliziotti. Su di lei pesa ora l'accusa di omicidio colposo e favoreggiamento dell'immigrazione clandestina.I due si erano imbarcati alle 12 di martedi scorso e il viaggio, iniziato alle ore 18, è durato quasi 24 ore. «La donna ci ha detto», raccontano i dirigenti della questura di Genova, «che per tutto il viaggio ha pensato alle condizioni di Amor e se era riuscito in qualche modo ad aprire il portabagagli per respirare. Ma nelle stive della nave non è potuta scendere per controllare se lui stava bene». L'arrivo a Genova è avvenuto mercoledi pomeriggio, alle 17,30, e Daniela, appena è salita in auto assieme ai due figli e il cane ha sentito un cattivo odore. «Si è spaventata», dicono i poliziotti che l'hanno portata poi in questura, «e non sapeva come fare per aprire il portabagagli perché c'erano i due bimbi». Appena fuori dal porto, invece di imboccare l'autostrada per Brescia, ha deciso di fare una deviazione verso Genova Quarto, dalla parte opposta della città. Si è fermata in una stradina e ha aperto il portabagagli. La scena è stata terrificante. Amor, sommerso da valige e borsoni, era morto e in via di decomposizione. Ha allontanato i bambini e chiesto aiuto ad alcuni passanti, poi ha chiamato il 118. La Sezione Omicidi della polizia è arrivata pochi minuti dopo. In un primo momento la donna ha negato si sapere chi fosse l'uomo morto nella sua auto. Poi è crollata e ha confessato: «E' il mio fidanzato. Ha viaggiato da clandestino perchè non aveva il permesso di soggiorno. Io non volevo ma lui ha insistito dicendo che lo fanno in tanti, che molti viaggiano nascosti nelle auto o nei camion. Allora gli ho detto che andava bene. Volevamo sposarci. Questi sono i documenti», ha detto mostrando le carte e piangendo davanti ai dirigenti della polizia genovese.Il cadavere è stato trovato rannicchiato in posizione supina, sopra aveva borse e valigie. L'uomo aveva perso sangue dal naso e dalla bocca, segno evidente di decomposizione. Amor Knis, secondo l'autopsia, è morto per collasso avvenuto per l'elevata temperatura all'interno dell'auto. Si è dunque sentito male a Tunisi, appena la vettura è entrata nella stiva: durante il tragitto avrebbe potuto aprire il portabagagli e respirare ma il caldo lo ha stroncato.",44.40565,8.946256,Genova,Italy,RAI/ANSA/ILM,ricerca.gelocal.it/gazzettadimantova/archivio/gazzettadimantova/2004/08/27/NA4PO_PA603.html,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1389,Anouska,19/02/2018,OK,13/01/2005,STEFANO

19/07/2004,19/07/04,1,"Sergey Baranyuk (31, man)",Ukraine,"suicide, hanged himself in Harmondsworth Centre (GB) in fear of deportation","A recent inquest into the death of Ukrainian asylum seeker Sergey Baranyuk provided a glimpse of how asylum seekers are treated behind the closed doors of removal centres in the UK – detained, forgotten and slowly driven to despair.Sergey Baranyuk travelled from the Ukraine to the UK and claimed asylum. He died awaiting voluntary removal. He was found hanged in a shower room at Harmondsworth removal centre near Heathrow airport in July 2004. His death sparked a night of disturbances at the centre and all of the detainees were transferred out of the damaged centre. More recently, the Chief Inspector of Prisons, Anne Owers, issued an inspection report that was ‘undoubtedly the poorest report we have issued’. It described an ‘over-emphasis on physical security – which was more appropriate to a high security prison than a removal centre’ where ‘over 60 per cent of detainees said they had felt unsafe’. The report was also critical of suicide prevention policies, finding that: ‘Most worryingly, a so-called action plan, to deal with problems identified by the inquiry into the recent self-inflicted death, had been shared with neither the suicide prevention team nor the staff in the centre. It was a purely bureaucratic exercise which had had no impact on the centre’s practices’, such inadequacies prevailed two years after the death of Sergey Baranyuk.FAST-TRACKEDSergey Baranyuk, 31, arrived in the UK on 24 May 2004 and claimed asylum the following day at Lunar House, Croydon. At his screening interview an immigration officer found his behaviour ‘strange’, he was seen speaking into his crucifix as if it were a phone. He was interviewed in Russian and was told that his claim would be dealt with in detention through the fast-track system at Oakington reception centre in Cambridge. The following day he was taken to Oakington.On 27 May, Sergey was seen by a doctor at Oakington because of his ‘disturbed behaviour’ and, because Oakington was seen as less secure a decision was made to move him to Harmondsworth. On 28 May, Sergey apparently decided to withdraw his asylum claim and agreed to voluntary removal from the UK. He was certified fit to travel by a nurse and the following day this decision was endorsed by an immigration officer. At some point before his transfer (at around 1.30pm) he signed a disclaimer to withdraw his asylum application, however he was still transferred to Harmondsworth where he was incorrectly assigned to the fast-track system. At the inquest, it was pointed out by an immigration officer from ‘MODCU’ (management of detained cases unit) that once Sergey had signed the disclaimer on 29 May his case should have been transferred to MODCU.LOCKED UP AND FORGOTTENOn arrival at Harmondsworth, a medical screening was carried out by a nurse who claimed Sergey spoke English well. The nurse examined Sergey and found him to be anxious. She noticed marks on his arms and he said that they were from 1994 and that he did not want to talk about them. She did not consider Sergey to be at any risk of suicide or self-harm. But she was not supplied with any records from Oakington, nor did she have transfer records which had noted that Sergey had special needs, had been ‘disruptive’ and that he was a suicide risk.After the initial medical screening Sergey did not come to the attention of the healthcare unit at any other point during the time he was detained. Neither did he make an impression on the detention custody officers or immigration officers who worked at Harmondsworth.On 7 June, at an interview with an immigration officer, Sergey signed a further disclaimer. He also told the immigration officer that he would try and get some ID papers to facilitate his travel arrangements. A decision was also made not to release Sergey on bail, as immigration officers did not anticipate any problems in returning him to the Ukraine, it was also noted that he was likely to abscond as Sergey had ‘shown a complete disregard to immigration rules’ and ‘used the asylum system to delay his removal’. The immigration officer failed to lodge an application for travel documents. Sergey’s case should have been reviewed every seven days but there was no paperwork evidence to show that this was done. Sergey was left to his own devices, detained and expecting to be sent home.Sergey was not seen (in person) by an immigration officer again. But a month later on 5 July, an immigration officer checking Sergey’s immigration file found that no travel documents had been applied for or received from Sergey, so he was transferred into long-term detention and became the responsibility of MODCU.On 11 July, MODCU accepted Sergey into long-term detention and on 16 July sent Sergey a two-line letter confirming this. No one is sure whether Sergey would have understood this letter. Then on 18 July, an immigration officer at MODCU sprang into action and sent a fax to the Immigration Service at Harmondsworth asking Sergey to fill in documentation as no application for emergency travel documents had been made. This ‘urgent action’ prompted the interview the following day, on 19 July, for which Sergey could not be found.Sergey could be seen (on CCTV) at 10.50am heading towards the shower room (C310 in C Wing). Two attempts were made to find him for a visit by an immigration officer. At 7.15pm, a senior detention custody officer (DCO) was alerted to the fact that Sergey was missing; he had not had lunch or dinner and had missed the appointment with immigration officials. The residential manager issued instructions for staff to guard the centre perimeter, as he was concerned that Sergey had absconded or was trying to. Sergey’s body was found at 7.50pm by DCOs, some nine hours after he was last seen alive.Ali McMurray of the Prisons and Probation Service Ombudsman (PPO), which investigates deaths in prison custody, told the inquest that the single most distressing feature of the case was that no one seemed to know anything about Sergey. She also raised concerns that nothing happened after 7 June – Sergey was effectively in indeterminate detention. Concerns were also raised that information from Oakington was not sent with Sergey to Harmondsworth, which meant the information about his bizarre behaviour was not available to the examining nurse.WHO WAS SERGEY BARANYUK?Very little is known about Sergey, as officers at Harmondsworth do not remember him. In written statements to the to police, Sergey’s roommate described him as introverted and quiet. After Sergey’s death the Immigration Service were unable to contact Sergey’s family. At the inquest, on finding that Sergey’s family had not been contacted, the coroner and her officers made every effort to contact them. Surprisingly they were able to do so, through the undertakers firm that repatriated Sergey’s body to the Ukraine. On the final day of the inquest, the coroner’s officers spoke to Sergey’s family (through an interpreter) who were able to give some basic details about Sergey and his reasons for travelling to the UK. Sergey’s sister had said that he was a divorced man with an 11-year-old child. He was happy, healthy, outgoing and good-natured. He had travelled to the UK as his mother had fallen ill and he wanted to send money home for her. He was a construction worker by trade. His family was very poor. He had no knowledge of English other than a few words. They were unaware of any scars on Sergey or that he had self-harmed. They said that he did not suffer from depression and had no knowledge of any history of mental health problems. The last contact he had with his family was at the end of May 2004, when he spoke to his father to congratulate him on his birthday.The inquest jury delivered a unanimous verdict that Sergey Baranyuk ‘took his own life’.",51.487613,-0.476616,Harmondsworth,GB,IRR/MSN/ERB/NCADC,http://www.irr.org.uk/news/sergey-baranyuk-forgotten-at-harmondsworth/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,1300,Klara,18/04/2017,OK,20/12/2004,START

(Rights First), has called on the state airline, Air France, to refuse to carry deportees as long as police continue ""committing barbaric acts with impunity"".But police have pointed out that officers ""are more and more often confronted by violent resistance"".A statement by the Central Board of the National Police on Tuesday said that officers had to handle 3,000 refusals to board planes in 2002 alone.",48.856614,2.352222,Paris,France,NCADC/AI/AN/VK/Vivre/MNS/borderzerolist/IND/JT/Statewatch/MUGAK/IRR/ BBC,http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2684213.stm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,1159,Christiane,19/12/2014,OK,20/12/2004,START

21/05/2001,21/05/01,1,"Shurat Tamo (14, girl)",Iraq,"Kurd, suicide in refugee centre De Lier (NL) after rejection of asylum application","In het asielzoekerscentrum in het Westlandse De Lier pleegde de 14-jarige Shurat uit Irak op 21 mei dit jaar zelfmoord. Vlak daarvoor had ze gehoord dat haar asielverzoek definitief was afgewezen. ""Nadat ze de brief van de advocaat gelezen had was ze erg verdrietig"", zegt haar moeder Layla Tamo die in 1998 met haar zeven kinderen naar Nederland kwam.Sinds 1998 geldt in Nederland het beleid dat uitgeprocedeerde Irakezen terug moeten naar Noord-Irak. Zo ook de familie van Shurat. Tot nog toe heeft de overheid niemand gedwongen om terug te keren. Uit de Zembla-documentaire 'Zelfmoord van een vluchteling', die vrijdag om 21.15 uur op Nederland 3 wordt uitgezonden, blijkt dat slechts enkelen vrijwillig zijn vertrokken.De schok was groot in asielzoekerscentrum De Lier, nadat Shurat een eind aan haar leven had gemaakt. Haar moeder merkte wel dat haar oudste dochter erg verdrietig was. Zelf trok ze zich de brief van de advocaat, waaruit duidelijk werd dat de familie was uitgeprocedeerd, niet zo heel erg aan: ""Er zijn heel veel Koerden uitgeprocedeerd, maar er is nog steeds niemand weggegaan. Dus ik dacht: het zal ons ook niet gebeuren"".BegeleidingPsycholoog Erwin Bijlsma deed voor de Vrije Universiteit van Amsterdam onderzoek naar zelfmoord onder asielzoekers: ""Asielzoekers plegen zesmaal zo vaak zelfmoord als normaal. Op het moment dat ze zijn uitgeprocedeerd houdt de begeleiding plotseling volledig op."" Bijlsma pleit voor meer begeleiding van asielzoekers. Ook het Centraal Orgaan Opvang Asielzoekers spreekt van een hiaat in de hulpverlening als asielzoekers hun definitieve afwijzing ontvangen.Ruim zeventienhonderd Irakezen zijn inmiddels uitgeprocedeerd. Enkele duizenden zijn nog in afwachting van de uitslag van hun aanvraag. De Nederlandse overheid vindt Noord-Irak sinds 1998 weer veilig. Wie is uitgeprocedeerd moet de opvang verlaten. Maar niet iedereen doet dat. Het kan soms jaren duren voordat iemand daadwerkelijk uit de opvang wordt gezet.ZwervenZembla sprak met de Irakees Hiwa Saba Mohamad, die - nadat hij was uitgeprocedeerd - nog anderhalf jaar in de opvang zat. Vorige week werd hij alsnog uit de opvang gezet. Hij is met onbekende bestemming vertrokken. Ook de Irakees Medhy Gully is niet terug naar Noord-Irak. Vier maanden nadat hij uit de opvang is gezet verblijft hij nog steeds illegaal in Nederland. De stichting Vluchteling Onder Dak ondersteunt hem financieel. ""Ik ga niet weg, ik zwerf nu maar ik kan niet terug gaan"".Tweede Kamer riep de staatssecretaris meerdere keren op meer werk te maken van de terugkeer. Van gedwongen uitzetten is tot nog toe geen sprake geweest. Wie is uitgeprocedeerd moet zelf de terugreis naar Noord-Irak organiseren. De IOM, de Internationale Organisatie voor Migratie, helpt daarbij en betaalt de reis. Dit jaar keerden slechts acht mensen vrijwillig via het IOM terug. En sinds eind mei ligt de tergkeer helemaal stil omdat de Turkse autoriteiten geen toestemming geven om door Turkije naar Irak te reizen.Inmiddels is de situatie in Noord-Irak na de terroristische aanslagen in Amerika onrustiger geworden. Het halfjaarlijks ambtsbericht over de veiligheid van Noord-Irak is daarom uitgesteld. Binnenkort beslist justitie of Noord-Irak nog wel veilig genoeg is om naar terug te keren. De familie van Shurat verblijft nog steeds in het asielzoekerscentrum.",51.974449,4.251163,De Lier,Germany,PRIME/BNNVARA,https://zembla.bnnvara.nl/nieuws/zelfmoord-van-een-vluchteling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,919,Klara,28/05/2018,OK,20/12/2004,START

Hij lag daarna enige weken dood in zijn woning in Veendam.Fatihy is een Palestijnse vluchteling die in 1994 in Nederland asiel aanvroeg. Dat werd afgewezen maar hij kreeg wel een vergunning tot verblijf op medische gronden. Want Fatihy was een psychiatrische patiënt.In Argos vandaag een reconstructie van deze zaak. Waarom pleegde Fatihy zelfmoord kort nadat hij gehoord was door de IND? Waarom bleef de IND druk op Fatihy uitoefenen ondanks verschillende medische verklaringen die dat afraadden, en ondanks het feit dat Fatihy al meerdere pogingen tot zelfmoord achter de rug had? Is het geval Fatihy een uitzondering of is er sprake van een structurele verwaarlozing van psychiatrische patiënten door de IND?Argos over de rol van de Immigratie- en Naturalisatiedienst (IND) bij de dood van Emad Fatihy Kafil Salem, een Palestijnse vluchteling wiens asielaanvraag in1994 werd afgewezen, maar die vanwege zijn psychische problemen in 1998 een vergunning tot verblijf kreeg en in 1999 zelfmoord pleegde.Vraaggesprekken met:- Hans Broer, medewerker van VluchtelingenWerk Nederland in het AZC Veendam waar Fatihy verbleef, tijdens een bezoek aan het graf van Fatihy op de Islamitische begraafplaats in Groningen;- Vincent Kuit, de raadsman van Fatihy;- Evert Bloemen, arts van Pharos, een landelijke organisatie die vluchtelingen en asielzoekers begeleidt;- Anton van Kalmthout, hoogleraar penitentiair recht aan de Katholieke Universiteit Brabant (telefonisch).Onderwerpen van gesprek zijn: de ontwikkelingen die aan de zelfmoord van Fatihy in 1999 voorafgingen; de reden van de asielaanvraag van Fatihy in 1994 en de afwijzing in 1996; Fatihy's psychische problemen en zelfmoordpogingen; het verzoek van de medische en juridische begeleiders van Fatihy aan de IND om Fatihy vanwege zijn psychische problemen een vergunning tot verblijf af te geven, hetgeen de IND pas in 1998 inwilligde; de zware druk die de IND op Fatihy uitoefende om vrijwillig naar zijn land van herkomst terug te keren; en de structurele onvolkomenheden in het beleid van de IND ten aanzien van vluchtelingen met psychiatrische problemen in het algemeen en ten aanzien van Fatihy in het bijzonder.Geïllustreerd met fragmenten van nagespeelde gehoren van Fatihy door medewerkers van de IND en met citaten uit Fatihy's asieldossier over onder meer zijn slechte psychische gesteldheid.Aansluitend een door de presentator voorgelezen reactie van de IND op de bevindingen van 'Argos'.----------Inleidende teksten, misschien niet volledig:Tekst 1Kritische geluiden. Kritische geluiden over de manier waarop in Nederland wordt omgegaan met asielzoekers die in psychische nood verkeren. Steeds meer asielzoekers die hun toevlucht nemen tot ons land, hebben psychische problemen; trauma’s, opgelopen in het land van herkomst, tijdens hun vlucht en tijdens de asielprocedure. Tegelijkertijd neemt de politieke en maatschappelijke druk op die asielprocedure steeds meer toe. En daarmee ook de druk op de ambtenaren die het asielbeleid moeten uitvoeren. En vooral ook de druk op de asielzoekers zelf, soms met fatale gevolgen. In Argos reconstrueren we vandaag de dood van Emad Kafil Salem Fatihy.Tekst 2Hans Broer, medewerker van Vluchtelingenwerk Nederland in het AZC, het Asielzoekerscentrum, Veendam. Hij is geschokt door de zelfmoord van Emad Kafil Salem Fatihy, die hij jarenlang begeleidde.Fatihy was een Palestijnse vluchteling met ernstige psychische problemen. In 1994 vroeg hij in Nederland asiel aan. De dood van Fatihy roept verschillende vragen op. Bijvoorbeeld of er een verband is tussen zijn zelfmoord en de gehoren die de IND, de Immigrate- en Naturalisatie Dienst, hem kort daarvoor afnam. En waarom bleef de IND druk op Fatihy uitoefenen ondanks verschillende medische verklaringen die dat sterk afraadden. En ondanks het feit dat Fatihy al meerdere pogingen tot zelfmoord achter de rug had?En: is het geval-Fatihy een uitzondering?Voor onze reconstructie spreken we met verschillende betrokkenen. Maar ook beschikken we over het uitgebreide asieldossier van Emad Fatihy.De Amsterdamse advocaat Vincent Kuit was zijn raadsman. Kuit vertelt op grond waarvan Fatihy in 1994 asiel aanvraagt.Tekst 3In december 1994 wordt Fatihy’s asielaanvrage afgewezen. Hij tekent bezwaar aan. In maart 1996 wordt ook daarop negatief beslist en is Fatihy uitgeprocedeerd. In tussentijd zwerft hij van AZC naar AZC en is hij er psychisch erg slecht aan toe. Al in november 1994 gaat het helemaal mis. De arts Van Rijswijk, verbonden aan het AZC Groesbeek, schrijft op 27 januari 1995:Tekst 4Als Fatihy is uitgeprocedeerd, wordt op 13 september 1996 overgeplaatst naar het vertrekcentrum in Ter Apel. Drie dagen later wordt hij daar ontboden bij Rob Klink, Medewerker Voorbereiding Vertrek bij de Immigratie- en Naturalisatiedienst, district Noordoost. Hij wordt gehoord omtrent zijn bereidheid mee te werken aan zin terugkeer naar het land van herkomst.Bij dit soort gehoren is een tolk aanwezig. Wij spelen delen van het gesprek tussen Klink en Fatihy letterlijk na, zoals ze door IND-ambtenaar Klink zijn opgetekend in zijn officiële rapportage aan het Hoofd van de IND.Klink begint.Tekst 5Twee dagen later wordt het gehoor vervolgd:Tekst 6In drie weken tijd neemt IND-ambtenaar Klink Fatihy in totaal vijf verhoren af. Op 9 oktober zegt Fatihy tegen Klink:Tekst 7Ambtenaar Klink adviseert Ehmad Fatihy dan contact op te nemen met de arts van het vertrekcentrum in Ter Apel. Fatihy antwoordt: Tekst 8Aldus Fatihy op 9 oktober 1996.De toestand van Fatihy verslechtert dusdanig dat iedereen het erover eens is dat er iets moet gebeuren. Op 16 oktober schrijft Els Ebes van de Stichting Rechtsbijstand Asiel, die het laatste gehoor heeft bijgewoond, aan de advocaat van Fatihy, Vincent Kuijt: Tekst 9Advocaat Kuijt:Hij is geplaatst in ter Apel, toen ging het veel slechter met hem, de arts kwam tot de conclusie dat hij suicidaal was, dat hebben we de ind duidelijk gemaakt en gevraagd om uitzetting op te schorten. En in nov 96 schrijft de IND dan dat er onderzoek door de GI wordt gedaan. Dat onderzoek heeft wel plaatsgevonden, maar is pas in juli 1997, maar het def. Advies was er pas in oktoberTekst 10Vanuit het vertrekcentrum Ter Apel komt Fatihy terecht in het Asielzoekerscentrum Veendam.Vanaf februari 1997 volgen ook daar weer verschillende gehoren, opnieuw afgenomen door IND-ambtenaar Rob Klink. Bijvoorbeeld op 24 april 1997: “Mijn gezondheid is slecht. Ik denk eraan om zelfmoord te plegen. Justitie is verantwoordelijkheid. Ik droom slecht, ik kan niet op mijn benen staan. Iemand probeert me te wurgen. Waarom bent u overgeplaatst. U gebruikte uw medicijnen niet goed. Soms voel ik dat die kat een deel van mij is. U bent nu toch goed te handhaven. Als ik naar buiten ben vergeet ik de problemen een beetje. U krijgt zwaardere medicijnen. Hebt u daar baat bij. Ik krijg maar medicijnen voor 3 dagen. Ik vraag dierenasiel aan. Ik heb gemerkt hoe ze dieren hier behandelen.”Tekst 11Op de vraag van Klink of hij nog op- of aanmerkingen heeft op het gesprek, zegt Fatihy: Tekst 12Met die “Hans van de VVN” doelt Fatihy op Hans Broer van de Veendamse afdeling van de Vereniging Vluchtelingenwerk Nederland. Broer was namelijk meegekomen naar het gehoor, maar werd door IND-ambtenaar Klink de toegang ontzegd. Broer kan zich dit incident nog goed herinneren, als we met hem op de islamitische begraafplaats in Groningen het graf van Fatihy opzoeken.Nee, het is voor mij de eerste keer. U hebt hem begeleid, wat voor man was hij. Hij was erg ziek, was verward. Gedurende de tijd dat ik hem gekend heb ik hem zien afglijden. Op een gegeven moment is er een brief van een aantal artsen. Daarin stond onder meer dat deze man niet gehoord mocht worden zonder begeleiding. Bent u ooit met hem mee geweest. Ik ben een keer mee geweest. Toen mocht ik niet blijven terwijl 2 gewapende marechaussees en een tolk wel mee mochten. Tekst 13Fatihy wordt steeds opnieuw weer gehoord door de IND, omdat zijn zaak zo complex is. Hij is “technisch onverwijderbaar”, zo schrijft de dienst zelf. Het is namelijk onduidelijk naar welk land hij terug zou moeten. En daarbij komen nog eens de medisch-psychische problemen. In Veendam wordt Fatihy behandeld door psychiater Laurens Ram, verbonden aan het RIAGG in Assen. Die schrijft op 16 mei 1997 aan advocaat Kuijt.Tekst 14Op 16 juni 1997 volgt er opnieuw een gehoor door IND-er Klink:“Meneer Salem, hoe gaat het met uw gezondheidSlecht, ik heb geen hoop meer. Ik ben naar u toe gekomen om een geneeskundige verklaring te ondertekenen. Door die verklaring te ondertekenen geeft u toestemming voor beoordeling. Hoe lang gaat het duren. U dient er rekening mee te houden dat we u toch proberen uit te zetten. Heeft hij met Ram gesproken. Ja, ik heb wel met hem gesproken.”Tekst 15Psychiater Ram schrijft op 24 juli 1997 opnieuw een brief. Dit keer aan de Geneeskundig Inspecteur op het ministerie van Justitie in Den Haag, de sociaal geneeskundige De Nooij.Tekst 16Op 14 augustus 1997 hoort IND-ambtenaar Klink in Veendam Fatihy opnieuw. Voorafgaande aan het gesprek wordt Klink benaderd door de arts Cecile de Ruiter van het AZC. Klink schrijft daarover in zijn rapportage over dat gehoor: “Voor aanvang van het gesprek deelde mevrouw De Ruiter, arts op AZC Veendam, mij mede dat het haar, medisch gezien, niet raadzaam leek om de heer Fatihy Kafil Salem zonder begeleiding te horen. Ik heb mevrouw De Ruiter meegedeeld dat de heer Fathi Kafil Salem volgens plan gehoord zou worden.” Een dag eerder had ook een andere arts al laten weten dat een gehoor zonder begeleiding niet raadzaam zou zijn. Klink negeert deze dringende medische adviezen en hoort Fatihy zonder begeleiding. Wél aanwezig bij het gesprek is iemand van de marechaussee. Tekst 17De gang van zaken is voor AZC-arts De Ruiter aanleiding om een officiële klacht in te dienen bij de heer Ballion, Hoofd Unit Verwijdering van de IND.Tekst 18De klacht van de artsen wordt uiteindelijk niet officieel behandeld. Op 29 oktober 1997 adviseert Geneeskundig Inspecteur De Nooij aan de IND Fatihy een tijdelijke verblijfsvergunning voor een jaar te verstrekken, opdat hij een psychiatrische behandeling kan ondergaan. Uiteindelijk zal hij die vergunning tot verblijf op medische gronden overigens pas in januari 1998 krijgen. Maar wel krijgt Fatihy’s advocaat Kuijt al in december een belangrijke toezegging van de heer Ballion, Hoofd Unit Verwijdering van de IND:Tekst 20Fatihy heeft nu een verblijfsstatus voor een jaar. Maar daarmee zijn de problemen niet opgelost. In maart 1998 schrijft behandelend psychiater Ram aan de Geneeskundig Inspecteur in Den Haag: Tekst 21Bij de verlening van de verblijfsvergunning voor een jaar in januari 1998 laat IND-ambtenaar Klink uitdrukkelijk aan advocaat Kuijt weten dat er met Fatihy “vooralsnog géén gesprekken zullen worden gevoerd welke bedoeld zijn om terugkeer naar zijn land van herkomst te effecturen”.Maar voordat het jaar om is, is het toch weer raak.Op 20 augustus 1998 wordt de Palestijn opnieuw door Klink gehoord, nadat Fatihy de ambtenaar plotseling heeft gebeld met de mededeling dat ie uit Syrië zou komen.Tekst 22Dat Fatihy in augustus 1998 opnieuw wordt gehoord, lijkt logisch. Hij heeft immers zélf de IND benaderd met nieuwe informatie. Maar advocaat Kuijt heeft toch een kanttekening bij de gang van zaken.Tekst 23In januari 1999 dient Fatihy een verzoek in tot verlenging van zijn verblijfsvergunning vanwege medische en humanitaire redenen. In mei 1999 krijgt de IND bericht van de autoriteiten uit Syrië dat de identiteit van Fatihy aan de hand van zijn vingerafdruk zou zijn vastgesteld. De hele machinerie om het uit te zetten komt dan opnieuw op gang. Maar eerst krijgt Fatihy in augustus nog een excuusbrief van de IND, omdat er nog steeds niet is beslist over de verlenging van zij verblijfsvergunning. Tekst 24Nog geen maand later krijgt Fatihy de aanzegging om op 28 september naar het Vertrekcentrum Ter Apel te komen om te praten over zijn vertrek uit Nederland beginnen de gehoren opnieuw. Dit keer doet IND-ambtenaar Gerard Mulder het gehoor. Ook dit keer is er behalve de tolk verder niemand bij het gesprek aanwezig. Mulder beschrijft in zijn verslag het eind van het gehoor als volgt.Tekst 25Op 22 oktober 1999 wordt Fatihy levenloos in zijn woning in Veendam aangetroffen. Hij is dan al enige wekken dood. Op grond van lege medicijnendoosjes die worden gevonden, komt men tot de conclusie: zelfmoord.De IND reageert op deze tragische gebeurtenis met een brief aan advocaat Kuit, geschreven door de heer Baljon, Hoofd Unit Verwijdering van de IND. Daarin staat onder meer:Tekst 26Advocaat Kuit:Tekst 27We leggen de zaak van Emad Fatihy voor aan Evert Bloemen. Hij is als arts verbonden aan Pharos, een landelijke organisatie die asielzoekers en vluchtelingen begeleidt. Tekst 28Ook de Tilburgse hoogleraar penitentiair recht Van Kalmthout bestudeert voor ons het dossier van Fatihy.

19/08/1999,19/08/99,1,Ousmane Sow,Guinea,died from liver infection in hospital in Conakry (Guinea) after violent deportation from Düsseldorf (D),"30. Juni 9914 Flüchtlinge aus Guinea und Sierra Leone werden über den Düsseldorfer Flughafen mit einer Maschine der Air Holland abgeschoben. Auch auf diesem Flug sind, nach Aussage eines Betroffenen, alle Gefangenen während des gesamten Fluges gefesselt. (siehe auch: 17. März 99)    Schon in der Vorbereitung dieser Abschiebung, am6. Mai, reiste der Polizeikommissar von Conakry, Mamadou Camara, in die BRD ein, verhörte die Gefangenen einzeln und bedrohte sie in ihren Landessprachen. Als deutsche Beamte nicht im Raum waren, nahm der Konsul Fofana Einsicht in die Asylunterlagen.    Deutsche FlüchtlingsunterstützerInnen baten Mitglieder der guineischen Menschenrechtsorganisation ""Organisation guinéenne des Droits de l'Homme"" (OGDH) und örtliche Journalisten schon vor der Abschiebung, die Ankunft der Gefangenen zu beobachten.    Unter dem Risiko, selbst ins Visier der Verfolger zu geraten, kann der guineische Journalist I.S. Barry dann erkunden, daß alle abgeschobenen Flüchtlinge aus der Maschine unmittelbar nach der Ankunft in Conakry Einzelverhören unterzogen und dann mit Militärfahrzeugen an unbekannte Orte gebracht werden. ""Seitdem wurde keiner mehr von ihnen gesehen, sie sind auch bisher nicht bei ihren Familien angekommen.""    Unter den Verschollenen sind auch sechs Männer, die schon Mitte März seelische und körperliche Torturen durch BGS-Beamten bei einem ersten Abschiebeversuch erleben mußten. (siehe hierzu 17. März 99)    Einer der Gefangenen, Herr Thierno Yanoussa Baldé, wird einige Tage nach seiner Abschiebung aus der Haft entlassen, darf sich aber zu den Umständen seiner Gefangenschaft und seiner Freilassung nicht äußern.    Zwei Monate später fliegen eine Vertreterin von IGFM und ein Journalist von mfm nach Guinea, um nach den abgeschobenen Flüchtlingen zu suchen.    Es gelingt ihnen nach undurchschaubarem Hin und Her mit Regierungsvertretern, Kaba Camara, Amadou Diallo (1) und Sekou Toure zu treffen. Die drei sind verängstigt und geben keinerlei Auskunft über ihren derzeitigen Aufenthaltsort. Die deutschen UnterstützerInnen schließen aus verschiedenen Gegebenheiten, daß diese drei Männer wahrscheinlich nur kurzfristig für dieses Treffen ""freigelassen"" wurden. Sekou Toure kann eine detaillierte Beschreibung des Krankheitsverlaufes von Ousmane Sow geben, woraus zu schliessen ist, daß die beiden lange Zeit an einem Ort zusammen waren.    Am 19. August 99 wurde Ousmane Sow in das Krankenhaus ""Ignace Deen"" in Conakry gebracht und erlag eine halbe Stunde später einem Leberkoma. Ousmane Sow hatte am Tage seiner Abschiebung aus der BRD eine ""Beruhigungsspritze"" intravenös verabreicht bekommen. Schon während des Fluges sagte er ständig ""...sie haben mich vergiftet"", und einige Tage später klagte er über zunehmende Übelkeit, konnte keine Nahrung bei sich behalten, bekam Durchfall und Erbrechen und fiel ins Koma.    Trotz intensiver Recherchen vor Ort bleibt das Schicksal folgender Menschen völlig ungeklärt – sie sind unauffindbar:Mamadou Ciré Sow (aus Sierra Leone), Abdoulaye Diallo, Kemoko Kourouma, Amara Camara, Amadou Diallo (2), Mamado Alinou Diallo, Alpha Oumar Diallo, Ibrahim Barry und eine weitere Person. Nach Informationen von OGDH-Mitgliedern, die sich auf Informationen der Familien stützen, sind drei von ihnen nicht mehr am Leben.    Auch einer der abgeschobenen anonym bleiben wollenden Flüchtlinge erklärt einige Monate später an Eides statt, daß zwei mit ihm abgeschobene Personen, Diallo (Vorname unklar) und Barry, mit denen er über einen Monat im Gefängnis saß, in diesem Gefängnis gestorben sind.    Das Medienbüro für Menschenrechte (mfm) erstattet am 22. Oktober 99 Strafanzeige gegen unbekannt, weil ""unbekannte Verantwortliche aus dem Bereich der örtlich zuständigen Ausländerbehörde, des Bundesamtes für die Anerkennung ausländischer Flüchtlinge sowie des Landes- und Bundes-Innenministeriums in rechtswidriger Weise eine Abschiebung von abgelehnten Asylantragstellern aus Guinea geduldet, angeordnet, unterstützt oder eingeleitet haben, anläßlich derer die abgeschobenen Personen körperlich mißhandelt, verschleppt und ......getötet worden sein können.""Hilfe für Menschen in Abschiebehaft Büren; IGFM; mfm;Brief junger guineischer Abschiebehäftlinge der JVA Büren 9.6.99;FR 4.9.99; ND 21.10.99;Depeschen Sept./Okt. 99; mfm 23.12.99;BT-Drucksache 14/2613; Depeschen März/April 2000;Depeschen aus Westafrika Mai 00",9.53795,-13.67729,,Africa,ARI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,543,Anouska,19/02/2018,OK,20/12/2004,START

03/01/1996,03/01/96,1,"A. Yhan (man, 25)",Kurdistan (Turkey),"suicide, hanged himself with phone cord fearing deportation after asylum application was refused in France","Il était kurde, il s'est penduPar Jean-Louis MALTERRE — 4 janvier 1996 à 00:19    Il était kurde, il s'est penduIl s'appelait A. Yhan. Il avait 25 ans. Il s'est pendu avec le fild'un téléphone.Il avait appris quelques jours auparavant le rejet par la Commission des recours des réfugiés de sa demande d'asile. Il pouvait encore saisir le Conseil d'Etat d'un hypothétique recours en cassation.Mais cela ne l'empêcherait pas, s'il était interpellé, d'être renvoyé de force, seul ou en charter, entre les mains de ses tortionnaires.Il s'était expliqué avec peine et par bribes car les violences subies l'avaient renfermé, et même aux plus proches des siens il parlait difficilement.Il venait de cette région de Turquie proche du mont Ararat qui est placé sous état d'urgence depuis des années.Nous savions que ce jeune paysan kurde avait, à peine âgé de 19 ans, été arrêté et torturé pendant vingt-cinq jours, soupçonné à juste titre d'aider la résistance kurde.Qu'il avait ensuite effectué les presque deux ans du service militaire obligatoire, durant lesquels, parce qu'il était kurde, il fut à maintes reprises puni, humilié, maltraité.De nouveau, en 1993, toujours soupçonné d'aider la guérilla, il avait été arrêté et torturé puis relâché au bout d'un mois après avoir été menacé de mort.En juin 1994, pris de panique à l'approche des militaires, il s'était réfugié dans les montagnes avoisinantes pour ne pas être à nouveau arrêté, interrogé, maltraité, ou éliminé, s'il ne voulait pas collaborer.De l'assassinat de son père par les soldats, il n'avait pas parlé. Et de combien d'autres choses?Nous avions compris que le combat pour que ses compatriotes vivent dignement et en liberté, dans un Kurdistan indépendant, était le sien, mais qu'il ne se sentait pas de force à prendre lui-même les armes. Peut-être même ne voulait-il pas participer à cette violence.Parce que, pour lui comme pour tant d'autres, c'était le pays des droits de l'homme et des libertés, il avait choisi la France.Confiant, il avait demandé l'asile et la protection de notre pays en application de la Convention de Genève.L'Ofpra (l'Office français pour la protection des réfugiés et des apatrides) l'avait convoqué, entendu, mais n'avait pas été convaincu, au motif que ses déclarations, «extrêmement sommaires», et «l'absence de personnalisation de son récit» ne permettaient pas «d'établir le bien-fondé de sa demande de reconnaissance de la qualité de réfugié»...L'officier de protection en le recevant n'a pas vu les cicatrices de son crâne ni de ses jambes pas plus qu'il n'a décelé, derrière son malaise apparent, la profondeur de son angoisse.Ceux qui côtoient les maltraités, les violentés, les torturés ne sauraient-ils pas entendre leurs silences?Alors, il a fait un recours.Avisés, ses amis l'ont conduit chez un médecin assermenté expert près la cour d'appel de Paris.Le certificat par lui établi décrivait les lésions sans aucune ambiguïté quant à leur origine ou leur compatibilité avec les sévices évoqués. Mais il insistait aussi sur les troubles neuropsychiatriques qu'ils avaient entraînés et les «risques d'évolution de cet état névrotique de type dépressif vers une comitialité post-traumatique».Assisté d'un avocat et muni de son certificat, il a donc comparu devant la Commission des recours des réfugiés, composée d'un conseiller d'Etat honoraire, du représentant du haut-commissaire des Nations unies et du représentant du conseil de l'Ofpra.Son recours a été rejeté par décision du 11 octobre 1995 ainsi libellée: «... le certificat médical produit n'établit pas que les faits constatés auraient pour origine les sévices allégués...».Aux peines endurées, à l'angoisse permanente, s'est ajoutée l'insupportable humiliation de l'incrédulité des juges de ce pays.Seul, dans sa chambre, la ficelle, trop mince, enroulée à son cou a rompu.Il s'est alors saisi du fil du téléphone pour mettre un terme définitif à ses souffrances.J'ai honte.Jean-Louis MALTERRE",48.929748,2.378314,,France,IRR/Libération,www.liberation.fr/tribune/1996/01/04/il-etait-kurde-il-s-est-pendu_160957,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,233,Anouska,19/02/2018,OK,20/12/2004,START

08/10/1991,08/10/91,1,"Omasase Lumumba (32, man)",Zaire,"heart attack by police’s use of force in Pentonville prison (GB), waiting asylum claim","AN asylum-seeker who died in a prison punishment cell while being forcibly restrained and stripped by up to seven prison officers was unlawfully killed, an inquest jury decided yesterday.Omasase Lumumba, 32-year-old nephew of the murdered Zairean president Patrice Lumumba, survived imprisonment and torture in his native country to die in a British jail.There were immediate calls for the Director of Public Prosecutions to investigate whether criminal charges should be brought against prison staff, and demands for a full public inquiry - not only into the circumstances surrounding the death but also into government policy which allows the practice of locking up asylum seekers as though they are criminals.The practice has been condemned by Amnesty International and other human rights organisations, such as Inquest and the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, which both added to calls from Mr Lumumba's family for further inquiries.Latest figures, for May this year, show that 441 people are being held in prisons under the Immigration Act. Like Mr Lumumba, some are held in their cells for up to 23 hours a day.Mr Lumumba fled Zaire after he and his brother had been held and beaten in August 1991. He was arrested in Catford, south London, on 15 September 1991, initially over the alleged theft of a bicycle - a charge not pursued. But he was then held under the Immigration Act and after five days in police custody transferred to Pentonville prison.The inquest jury at St Pancras coroner's court, north London, heard that the immigration officer who questioned Mr Lumumba knew little of Zaire and had never heard of Patrice Lumumba.While in Pentonville, Mr Lumumba became depressed, angry and unable to comprehend his imprisonment. On 8 October - 18 days after he was sent to prison - he was taken to the segregation or punishment block for disobeying an order to return to his cell. Six officers took part in his removal, but when a doctor was called to sedate him, Mr Lumumba was found to be dead.The cause of death is uncertain but Vesna Djuovic, the pathologist, said there was a 'strong possibility' he had suffered an acute cardiac arrest following a prolonged struggle against restraint. A less likely option was asphyxiation.Andrew Durance, a fellow prisoner, had described seeing officers standing on Mr Lumumba, kicking him and jumping up and down on him. The officers maintained they had not used unreasonable or excessive force and had only applied approved control and restraint techniques.The coroner, Dr Douglas Chambers, had ruled that the inquest jury could not return a verdict of unlawful killing or lack of care, because of the absence of conclusive evidence about the medical cause of death. But yesterday he had to redirect jurors after the High Court ruled last May he was wrong to keep the options from them.Yesterday the jury foreman said that by an eight-to-one majority, jurors had decided Mr Lumumba died 'as the result of the use of improper methods and excessive force in the process of control and restraint'.The Home Office said yesterday it would look at all the circumstances. The Prison Service Agency said it was seeking legal advice about 'how to take the matter forward'.",51.544982,-0.116297,London,GB,IRR/Independent,http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/asylum-seekers-jail-death-was-unlawful-presidents-nephew-escaped-torture-in-zaire-to-die-in-british-1487601.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,2062,Klara,13/06/2017,New entry,28/03/2008,EMAIL
